## History

- Origination: I approached learning Python by choosing a problem to solve. The small task that I took on was to work toward downloading every blog post on Patheos.com (large, multi-section, multi-tenant blogging site). I bit off more than I could chew and had to rise to the occasion.

- blog pages from blogs
- posts content from blog pages
- export to csv
- export to xlsx
- insert into Oracle database tables (3, for category, blog, and posts

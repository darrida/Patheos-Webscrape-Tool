0,Love Overcomes Evil: Here\u2019s Proof,"April 25, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nQuite often when I talk about following Jesus into preemptive love or proactive agape, people will argue that nonviolence doesn\u2019t work.\nBut it does.\nEven in World War 2 \u2013 the one example brought up most often in discussions like this \u2013 the Nazi\u2019s admitted after the war that they were totally unprepared for how to respond to nonviolent resistance.\n\n\n\u201cB.H. Liddell-Hart, widely acknowledged as the foremost military writer of our times, discovered in his interrogation of Nazi generals after World War II that they had little trouble dealing with violent resistance except in mountainous areas of Russia and the Balkins, or where advancing armies were close. But they expressed complete inability to cope with nonviolence as practiced in Denmark, Holland, Norway, and, to a lesser extent, in France and Belgium.\n\u201c\u2019They were experts in violence, and had been trained to cope with opponents who used that method. But other forms of resistance baffled them. They were relieved when nonviolence was mixed with guerilla operations, which made it easier to combine suppressive action against both at the same time.\u2019\n\u201cThe generals found friendly noncompliance more frustrating than any other form of resistance, and had no effective means to counter it. \u2018If practiced with a cheerful smile and an air of well-meaning mistake, due to incomprehension or clumsiness, it becomes even more baffling\u2026. This subtle kind of resistance cannot really be dealt with in terms of force: indeed, nothing can deal with it. There is really no answer to such go-slow tactics.\u201d\xa0 [Excerpt from \u201cEngaging the Powers\u201d by Walter Wink]\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Several studies have been done by those who were initially skeptical of the effectiveness of non-violence and their findings were conclusive: Non-violence resistance works!\nIf you\u2019re curious, you can watch this lecture by\xa0author and researcher Erica Chenoweath entitled \u201cWhy Civil Resistance Works: Non-Violence in the Past and Future.\u201d\nHer research supports the viability of non-violence as an effective tool in the face of real-world violence and oppression.\nOr, you can watch this awesome TED Talk by Scilla Elworthy about the power of \u201cFighting With Nonviolence\u201d\nBetter yet, watch the shorter YouTube clips of actual people who were either changed by preemptive love, or who transformed their attackers by responding with love and compassion rather than aggression and violence.\nFirst: The Mother of a mass shooter is forever changed by the love and forgiveness of the survivors.\n\n\n\n\xa0\nNext: Watch how these people disarmed a robber with glass of wine and a group hug.\n\n\xa0\nNext: Listen to this real-life story of what happens when you give the person who wants your wallet your jacket as well.\n\nFinally: Get ready to have your mind-blown listening to this powerful testimony of how love transformed this man\u2019s life forever.\n\n\n\n\xa0\nDoes non-violence work? Yes!\nDoes love transform us? Absolutely!\nIs this better than responding with violence?\n\n\nYou tell me.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

1,Things That Make For Peace,"April 23, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nThe church bombings on Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka were directly in retaliation for the Mosque shooting in New Zealand last month.\nWhere does it end?\nThis Us vs Them mentality starts out as simple tribalism, but very quickly escalates into violence, war and eventual annihilation.\nYou disrespect me and I will disrespect you.\n\n\nYou beat up one of my tribe, I attack three of yours.\nYou kill one of mine, I kill five of yours.\nYou kill ten of mine, I kill twenty.\nOn and on it goes until this path leads us to more bloodshed than either can bear.\nBut what if there was another path? What if we could stop this inevitable back-and-forth retaliation process?\nHere\u2019s what it would take: Someone \u2013 at any point in that chain \u2013 responding with kindness, forgiveness and mercy.\nJesus showed us that there were two paths: The one we\u2019ve been on from the very beginning, and this new path that breaks the pattern and gives us a way to remake the world.\nThis is what the prophet Isaiah foretold when he spoke of the coming Messiah who would show us another path to walk down; one which would lead those who follow it to decide to beat their weapons into garden tools and to study war no more. [See Isaiah 2:3-5]\nBut, notice, this has to be their decision. They have to walk this Messiah\u2019s path of peace. They have to agree that his path is better. They have to be the ones to take their own weapons and mangle them into shovels and hoes and rakes. They have to be the one who \u2013 on their own \u2013 decide that they will study war no longer.\n\n\nThat is how we break the pattern. This is how we stop the bloodshed.\nWe have to wake up and see that Jesus \u2013 the Prince of Peace \u2013 has already shown us this path. Now, we have to walk that path if we hope to arrive at the destination where war and weapons of war are obsolete; where in place of the battlefield there is a garden; where in place of bloodshed there is fruit and life for everyone.\nMy concern is that the followers of Christ have still yet to realize this truth. We are still blind to this path. We are yet unconvinced that this is what Jesus came to show us.\nAnd until we wake up and realize this, and begin to consistently embrace his message of enemy love \u2013 blessing those who curse us, doing good to those who hate us, overcoming evil with good, and casting out darkness with light \u2013 how will anyone else get it?\nMost of us are still waiting for Jesus to arrive in the clouds one day and make it all better. We\u2019re waiting for Jesus to return and sprinkle the love dust on everyone so we can live in this perfect peace that he promised us. But that\u2019s not at all the way it works.\nJesus showed us the path. He modeled enemy love for us. He taught us how to turn the other cheek, bless those who curse and overcome evil with good. We have seen his path. Now we have to decide if we\u2019re ready to walk in it or not.\n\n\nAfter laying all of this out for us, Jesus ended his Sermon on the Mount by pleading with us: \u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord, Lord\u2019 and do not do what I say?\u201d\nUntil we move from calling Jesus our Lord and actually putting his teaching, and his example, into practice, there will be no peace.\nWhat all creation is longing for is not the return of Christ. It\u2019s for the children of God to be revealed:\n\u201cFor the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.\xa0For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope\xa0\xa0that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.\u201d [Romans 8:19-21]\nNow, I ask you, what did Jesus say about those who are the children of God? He told us that those who love their enemies, turn the other cheek and bless those who hate us are like their Father in Heaven, because this is how God loves His enemies: He sends rain on the just and the unjust alike.\n\n\n\n\nThis is what the whole creation is groaning for: Not the return of Christ, but the Children of God who will be like their Father \u2013 and His Son; those who are walking in the pattern that was given to us from on High.\nAre you ready to walk this path? Are you ready to \u201cliberate [creation] from its bondage and decay and bring it into the freedom and glory of the children of God?\u201d\nI feel creation groaning for that day.\nI pray it comes soon.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

2,Is Christ Risen?,"April 20, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nWe, the Church, are the Body of Christ. We are the physical representation of Jesus in the world today.\nAs the Body of Jesus, we seem to be much more comfortable in the dark of the tomb, wrapped in our own shroud, meditating on this death of our Lord, with the stone rolled shut across the door.\nWe ignore that what we are called to do \u2013 as the living Body of Jesus \u2013 is to go out and proclaim, demonstrate and testify with our lives the awesome miracle that \u201cJesus is Alive!\u201d and that we are living examples of this fact.\n\n\nWhat I long for is the day when we are bold enough to declare, as one people, with one voice, that Jesus is Alive, and that our conduct in the world would bear witness to this fact.\nOur inactivity, our apathy, our aversion to serve others and live out the compassion of Jesus, sadly proclaims that Jesus is dead.\nIt\u2019s when we live for Him, when we continue to love the way He did, when our lives are in sync with His, that we proclaim by our actions that, yes, indeed, Jesus is really alive!\nIs Jesus really alive? Has He really come to live in your life? And how would anyone know this to be true if you never actually demonstrated the life and love and ministry of Jesus in your own life?\nDo we, as individual followers of Jesus, feel safer within the quiet of the tomb? Or are we willing, even eager, to roll away the stone and begin to live the truth of the power of the Gospel?\nIf we, the Body of Jesus, do not act as a living Jesus would, within this world, loving those He loved, sharing with those He spent time with, continuing His ministry of transformation, then we do not demonstrate that Jesus is alive, we simply testify that He has died.\nWhat we must do is to wake ourselves from our slumber, shake off the apathy, and begin to proclaim, with our own lives, that Jesus is truly alive.\n\n\n\u201cI tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.\u201d- John 14:12\n\u201cWhoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.\u201d- 1 John 2:6\nIs He Risen?

3,Did Jesus Say That?,"April 19, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nI\u2019ve started to notice that the wisdom of Jesus is a bigger part of our collective intelligence than I ever realized before. I often hear people who are not followers of Jesus quote Him in their conversations with one another. This made me wonder just how many of the phrases we commonly use are actually attributed to the words of Jesus.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what I found:\nGoing the extra mile \u2013 Mt 5:40-42\nThe truth will set you free \u2013 John 8:32\nThe spirit is willing but the flesh is weak \u2013 Mk 14:38\nBeware of wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing \u2013 Mt 7:15\nThe Good Samaritan \u2013 Lk 10:30\n(He/she is) the salt of the earth \u2013 Mt 5:13\nDon\u2019t cast your pearls before swine \u2013 Mt 7:6\nThe blind leading the blind \u2013 Mt 15:14\nCount the cost \u2013 Lk 14:28\nDo unto others \u2013 Lk 6:27-31\nThe left hand doesn\u2019t know what the right hand is doing \u2013 Mt 6:3-4\nMan does not live by bread alone \u2013 Lk 4:3-4\nThe Straight and Narrow Path \u2013 Mt 7:13-14\nTurn the other cheek \u2013 Mt 5:38-40\nThe Prodigal returns \u2013 Lk 15:11-13\nI think the next time I hear someone who is not a Christian use one of these phrases I\u2019ll ask them if they realize that they\u2019re quoting Jesus.\nCan you think of any other common phrases that originated with Jesus?

4,Love Beyond Labels,"April 18, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nYou can\u2019t really love the Homeless until you love Debbie or Steve [who happen to be homeless].\nYou can\u2019t really say you love the LGBTQ community until you love Scott or Hannah or Jasmine [who happen to be Gay, Trans and Lesbian].\nYou can\u2019t really love Muslims until you love Usha, or Ibrahim [who are Muslims].\n\n\nYou can\u2019t really love any group of people as long as you only see them as an anonymous collective that sits behind a label.\nAnd that\u2019s the point. As long as we relate to Muslims, Lesbians, Homeless, Refugees, etc. as categories, we will never come to see them as human beings who \u2013 like us \u2013 are worthy of love, respect, compassion, dignity and human rights.\nEven once you do know these people intimately, you cannot easily continue to refer to their groups in such broad strokes as \u201cMuslims\u201d or \u201cHomeless\u201d or \u201cTransgender\u201d, or any other label without realizing that all of the people in that group are not the same.\nWe usually only notice this when we hear someone refer to our particular group in this way in order to make a broad-brush generalization about us. We bristle instinctively. We are quick to cry foul. We shout at our TVs or curse at our laptops \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re not all the same!\u201d\nSo, whenever we feel tempted to say things like \u201cAll Homeless people are lazy\u201d or \u201cAll Muslims hate our freedoms\u201d or \u201cAll Refugees are dangerous criminals\u201d, etc. we have to stop ourselves and realize that this is only possible to say if you don\u2019t actually know anyone in one of those groups.\n\n\nBecause once you actually know someone who is Homeless, you cannot ever again agree with the statement \u201cAll Homeless people are lazy\u201d because the one\u2019s you know aren\u2019t all lazy. Many of them work harder than you and I work. They are doing all they can to survive every single day.\nAnd once you actually know someone who is Muslim, you cannot ever again sit quietly while someone says \u201cAll Muslims hate our freedoms\u201d or suggests that they all want to kill Christians and impose Sharia Law. Because the Muslims you\u2019ve met are kind, sincere, loving and very, very \u201cnormal\u201d people who \u2013 other than their religion \u2013 are exactly like you and me.\nTherefore, let\u2019s try to meet people who are not like us. Let\u2019s try to see them as they are \u2013 human beings who are members of the same human race. Let\u2019s learn to love those who are different, and to see Christ in them, realizing that we are all part of one family, under God our Father; the One in whom we all live and move and have our being.\nUntil we can learn to love without labels, we will never learn to love as Christ commanded us to love.\n\n\n**\nJoin me this summer at one of these upcoming events:\n*El Paso, TX \u2013 May 19 \u201cUnited We Stand\u201d\n\n\n*Costa Mesa, CA \u2013 June 22\xa0\u201cUnited We Stand\u201d\n*Hot Springs, NC \u2013 July 11-14\xa0\u201cWild Goose Festival\u201d\nWant Keith to come speak at your church or in your home town?\xa0Learn more\xa0HERE\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

5,Our Interactive Good Friday Service,"April 17, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nFor the last few years, our family would host an interactive and meditative Good Friday experience in our home.\nWe\u2019d spend the day setting up different stations around our house and invite our neighbors, our friends, our house church family and pretty much anyone who wanted to join us to participate.\nIn the evening, just as the sun was going down, people would enter the house quietly and visit the various stations spread throughout our home in any order they wanted to.\n\n\nAt one station they\u2019d drive nails into wood. The sound of the hammers would echo throughout the house.\n\n\xa0\nAt another station they would hold a large crown of thorns which Wendy had woven together from our thorn bush in the back yard.\n\nAt another station, they could dip a Q-tip into a bowl of red vinegar and taste what Jesus tasted as they lifted up the sponge dipped in vinegar as he cried out in thirst from the cross.\n\n\xa0\nAt another station, they could tear a patch of cloth and rip it in half, just as the veil in the Temple had been rent in two as Jesus said, \u201cIt is finished!\u201d\nAt yet another station, they could throw the dice and remember how the soldiers cast lots for Christ\u2019s robe as he suffered on the cross.\n\n\n\n\xa0\nAt another station, they could partake in the bread and the wine, in remembrance of Christ\u2019s proclamation that he was giving his body and his blood for us as a sign of the New Covenant.\n\nAt the final station, they could reflect on the sacrifice Christ made for them personally by dipping their hands in red paint and placing their hand prints on a white sheet of paper.\n\nAfter everyone had silently walked through the house and visited each station, they were invited to come into our den and sit quietly in the dark, holding candles. Once everyone had come through, we would sit and sing songs of thanksgiving, and share scriptures remembering His sacrifice for us.\n\n\nWhen we were all done, we\u2019d each extinguish candles one by one with a word of grateful remembrance and all would exit in silence.\nWhat I loved most about these evenings was how no one wanted to leave. Especially the children from our neighborhood. They\u2019d just keep returning to the stations to reflect on different aspects of Christ\u2019s passion for us and what happened to Jesus that day.\nHonestly, this was really what made me fall in love with Holy Week, and I miss hosting these in our home.\nIf you\u2019d like to try it, feel free to adapt these and maybe add other ideas to make it your own.\n\n\nI promise you\u2019ll be profoundly touched and blessed by this experience.\n**\nJoin me this summer at one of these upcoming events:\n*El Paso, TX \u2013 May 19 \u201cUnited We Stand\u201d\n*Costa Mesa, CA \u2013 June 22\xa0\u201cUnited We Stand\u201d\n\n\n*Hot Springs, NC \u2013 July 11-14\xa0\u201cWild Goose Festival\u201d\nWant Keith to come speak at your church or in your home town?\xa0Learn more\xa0HERE\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

6,Dear Church: Time Is Running Out,"April 16, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nThe signs are obvious. There\u2019s not much time left for us to correct our course before it\u2019s too late.\nYoung people are leaving the faith in record numbers\nPolitical divisions have created a fractured and broken church community\n\n\nEvangelical churches are growing older and less relevant\nMost young people say that politics in the pulpit is driving them away from church\xa0\nAnd they\u2019re\xa0 not coming back.\nSo, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to do something.\nFirst, I\u2019m teaching a 3 week course through BeADisciple.com and Southwestern College to help pastors and other church leaders understand the problem.\nUnited We Stand is an online class that runs 5 days a week starting Monday, April 22. We\u2019ll walk through each chapter of my book \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d together, and engage in online discussions to learn how the Christian Church in America got so entangled with politics, and how we can break free to find unity again \u2013 and get back to our original mission to live out the reality of the Gospel of Christ.\nLearn more about the online class and register HERE\n\n\nThe second thing I\u2019m doing is to travel to different churches around the nation this summer to host \u201cUnited We Stand\u201d events.\nSo far we\u2019ve set up meetings in these cities:\nEl Paso, TX \u2013 May 19 \u2013 First Presbyterian Church [Free Admission]\nCosta Mesa, CA \u2013 June 22 \u2013 First United Methodist Church [Registration $19.99]\nNew dates are pending in Atlanta, GA, Phoenix, AZ, Cincinnati, OH and Boise, ID at the moment.\nIf you\u2019re interested in having me come to speak to your church about this important topic, please visit: www.FaithandPolitics.us\nOr send an email to Quoir Author Management: Barrett@quoir.com\nThe bottom line is this: If we sit back and do nothing, the Church will continue to become more divided, more irrelevant to the next generation, and have less impact on our community for the Gospel of Christ.\n\n\nThe time to heal is now. The time to crucify our politics is now.\n\n\nTomorrow will be too late.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

7,Everyone Is Someone\u2019s Heretic,"April 12, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nIt started in September of 2017. Three authors who did not agree on everything theologically came together to agree on one thing: We can love and respect people even if we disagree.\nSince then, the three of us \u2013 that\u2019s me, Jamal Jivanjee and Matthew Distefano \u2013 have recorded almost 50 episodes of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast which have been downloaded over 100,00 times [to date].\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had some amazing conversations with people like avowed atheist Bart Ehrman, political radio personality and comedian John Fugelsang, theologian Richard Rohr, former pastor Bishop Carlton Pearson, author William Paul Young, and dozens more.\nThe podcast spawned a private Facebook group and a Patreon page where supporters get even more exclusive interviews and bonus podcast content, plus a board game designed by the 3 hosts called \u201cThe Slippery Slope\u201d [to be released soon].\nWe\u2019ve even put together our own t-shirt store so listeners can spread this heresy far and wide with messages like \u201cGod Loves Gays\u201d and \u201cAgape Against The Machine.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve even created subversive Christian throw pillows to troll your unsuspecting friends with Bible verses that don\u2019t usually inspire warm thoughts, like the verse where David blesses those who dash babies against the rocks or the one that celebrates the impalement of two lovers with a spear, for example.\n\n\nBut, the fun and games are just a small part of what\u2019s going on at the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast. We do take the whole \u201cheretic\u201d thing seriously. Why? Because all three of the hosts have been labeled as a Heretic for affirming LGBTQ people, questioning Penal Substitutionary Atonement Theory, rejecting Eternal Conscious Torment, affirming Patristic Universalism, critiquing Christian Nationalism, espousing non-violence, rejecting Biblical Inerrancy and many other views that question the status quo.\n\n\nOur response is to run with the label \u201cHeretic\u201d because everyone is someone\u2019s heretic. Meaning: Everyone holds a view that another person might call \u201cHeretical.\u201d So, we\u2019ve decided to embrace \u2013 tongue-in-cheek \u2013 the term \u201cheretic\u201d and mock the whole idea of labelling people we disagree with in order to dismiss them. Instead, we are willing to say, \u201cSure, I\u2019m a heretic. But so are you. Let\u2019s sit down and listen to one another anyway.\u201d\nSee, what\u2019s ridiculous is that the term \u201cHeretic\u201d has come to refer to anyone who happens to hold a different view theologically than you do. [As if you were the standard of truth and couldn\u2019t possibly be wrong about anything].\nBut, the actual word \u201cHeresy\u201d simply means \u201ccausing division\u201d and in the New Testament the emphasis is on the sin of dividing the Church, not about false teaching.\nSee, unity is a big deal for Jesus. He prayed that we would be one as He and the Father are one. He said that our unity would be a sign to the world that Jesus was actually the Messiah sent from God.\nThis is also why Jesus commanded us to love one another as He has loved us \u2013 which is to say \u2013 extravagantly and unconditionally.\n\n\nPaul also stressed unity in his epistles to the early Christian assembly. He rebuked the Corinthians for dividing over which Apostle they like best. He reminded the Galatians that we are no longer divided by race, or status, or gender, but that we are all one in Christ. He rebuked the Romans for dividing over whether or not eating meat sacrificed to idols was right or wrong and told them to each be convinced in their own mind, but to remain in unity as brothers and sisters in Christ.\nHe even suggested that it was ok to just allow oneself to be wronged as long as unity in the Body of Christ was maintained.\nUnity was \u2013 and is \u2013 crucial. People will know that we are the followers of Christ if we have love for one another. So, it\u2019s a very big deal.\n\n\nIt\u2019s why Paul warned us in Titus to warn a divisive person twice and then have nothing more to do with them if they refused to stop dividing the Church.\nSo, the idea of dividing that Body was heresy. It went against everything that Jesus and His Apostles stood for.\nHeresy, is about division. This means one could be guilty of heresy while teaching the truth.\nHow? By using the truth to divide the Body of Christ.\n\n\nOne could also be a heretic for simply saying this: \u201cI cannot fellowship with anyone who disagrees with my theology.\u201d\nOnly a heretic divides the Body of Christ over differences in theology.\nThe irony, of course, is that people do this all the time. Hardly a day goes by on Facebook where someone doesn\u2019t say exactly this \u2013 \u201cI cannot fellowship with anyone who disagrees with my theology\u201d \u2013 and usually in the process that same person will accuse those who disagree with them of being heretics.\nBut the only heretic is the one who divides the Body of Christ \u2013 even if they are technically correct in their theology.\nSo, please don\u2019t be a heretic. Don\u2019t divide the Body of Christ over your own views of scripture. Don\u2019t insist that everyone must agree with you on ever single point before you\u2019ll accept them into your fellowship.\nOur unity is in Christ. Not in our agreement.\nAs our podcast motto says: It\u2019s about burning questions, not people.\n**\nJoin me this summer at one of these upcoming events:\n*El Paso, TX \u2013 May 19 \u201cUnited We Stand\u201d\n\n\n*Costa Mesa, CA \u2013 June 22\xa0\u201cUnited We Stand\u201d\n*Hot Springs, NC \u2013 July 11-14\xa0\u201cWild Goose Festival\u201d\nWant Keith to come speak at your church or in your home town?\xa0Learn more\xa0HERE\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

8,Bible Psychosis Syndrome: Know The Symptoms,"April 10, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nDo you suffer from BPS [Bible Psychosis Syndrome]? It\u2019s more common than you might realize. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to diagnose the symptoms:\n*Do you find yourself easily confused by statements in the Bible that suggest that the Bible isn\u2019t your authority?\n*Do you often use the phrase \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t know that if it wasn\u2019t in the Bible!\u201c, especially in response to statements from the Bible that point to Christ [but not to the Bible]?\n\n\n*Do you sometimes think that statements in the Bible are more significant than the ideas they communicate?\n*Is your experience of God limited to the words you read about God in the Bible?\n*Do you find it impossible to hear God\u2019s voice without your Bible?\n*Do you treasure the Bible more than you do the fellowship of the Holy Spirit?\n*If you had a choice between your Bible or a direct connection with Christ, which would you choose? [If you said, \u201cThe Bible\u201d then you should seek immediate help.]\n*Do you know the difference between a Biblical truth and a Christlike truth?\n*Which is more important to you: The truth communicated in the Bible, or the fact that the Bible contains the truth. [For example: If Jesus says [in the Bible] that all authority in Heaven and on Earth was given to Him, does that mean the Bible is your authority [because you read this in the Bible] or that Christ is your authority [because this is what Jesus says in the Bible].\n*Ask yourself: If the Bible wasn\u2019t Canonized until the Fourth Century, then how did Christians know God for the first 400 years of Church history?\n*How would you react if someone said, \u201cThere is no life in the Bible!\u201d\n\n\n*What if that person was Jesus?\n*What if that phrase was in the Bible?\n*Does the fact that Jesus is recorded in the Bible as saying that there is no life in the Bible make your brain explode?\n*When Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for blaspheming the Holy Spirit, it was because they refused to believe what they were experiencing in that moment [based on their understanding of what was written in the Scriptures]. Are you in danger of committing the unforgivable sin because you refuse to let go of what God was doing 2,000 years ago so you can see and experience what God wants to do in the world today?\nIf you have any trouble reconciling the differences between the Word of God [Jesus] and the Bible [the Book that we wrote about God], you may suffer from Bible Psychosis Syndrome. The only cure is to recognize that the Word of God was made flesh, dwelt among us, revealed the Father to us and now abides in everyone who abides in Christ.\nJesus is not bound in any book. Jesus is the living, active Word of God. To know Christ is to know the Father, and this knowing is an intimate encounter that conceives new life within you.\nListen to the voice of the Word of God. His still, small voice is speaking even now.\n\n\nCan you hear it?\n\n\n**\nJoin me this summer at one of these upcoming events:\n*El Paso, TX \u2013 May 19 \u201cUnited We Stand\u201d\n*Costa Mesa, CA \u2013 June 22 \u201cUnited We Stand\u201d\n*Hot Springs, NC \u2013 July 11-14 \u201cWild Goose Festival\u201d\nWant Keith to come speak at your church or in your home town?

9,Worthless? Remembering My Friend Robert Higgins,"April 9, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\nNOTE: This post was originally written April 30, 2010.\xa0\nLast week I had lunch with my friend, Robert Higgins. Every Friday he and I spend an hour together and share lunch in his room at Fountain Care.\nRobert is 78 years old. He has bone cancer. He is on Hospice Care now.\n\n\nWhen I first met him he was homeless. The manager of the motel in Santa Ana where we\u2019ve been serving introduced me to Robert. When Pete, the manager, called me on my cell phone about a year and a half ago he asked if our house church could help Robert get into one of the rooms at the motel on a regular basis. Robert was sick and, at the time, it was winter and a cold rain had settled over Orange County. Pete told me, \u201cKeith, if I send him back out in this weather I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t live through the night.\u201d\nSo, we helped Robert to get into the motel room. I visited him now and again to check up on him and make sure he was taken care of. This was before we knew about his bone cancer.\nOver the last year or so I\u2019ve learned a little about Robert\u2019s life growing up. I\u2019ve listened to him share stories about his own mistakes with his children and his marriage. I\u2019ve watched him share about his failures and his regrets with tears in his eyes.\nOne thing about Robert that seems to keep recurring is his low self esteem. He\u2019s always talking to me about how he\u2019s not worth anything and how no one in his life ever saw much good in him.\n\n\nLast Friday, as we shared lunch together, Robert made me laugh out loud. He was talking to me about his time on the street and how his other homeless friends would chide him for not carrying a sign \u2013 \u201cHomeless. Will work for food.\u201d Robert refused. \u201cThey told me I needed to swallow some of my pride,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, naw, naw, as long as I\u2019m able to work I\u2019m not gonna stand on a street corner and beg for money.\u201d\nRobert said there was one time in his life when he did consider carrying a sign. \u201cWhen I was really depressed and suicidal,\u201d he said, \u201cI did think about making a sign and carrying it around that said, \u2018Homeless. Worthless. Please shoot me.'\u201d\nI confess that when Robert said that to me I laughed out loud. Actually, we both laughed pretty hard about that, but I knew what he was telling me came from a place of real pain in his heart.\nSlowly, over the last several months, I\u2019ve been able to encourage Robert about his worth. I\u2019ve reminded him that God has placed a large group of people around him who really love him and value him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like God has put a spotlight on you, Robert. People just seem to pick you out of the crowd and give you special attention,\u201d I said.\n\n\nRobert\u2019s eyes filled with tears and he nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout the last year, once I met you and Pete, it\u2019s like you said, people seem to pick me out of the crowd and show me special attention.\u201d\nI waited until Robert composed himself and then I said, \u201cThat\u2019s God showing you that He loves you, Robert. He\u2019s put all these people in your life to let you know He sees you and He loves you. He hasn\u2019t forgotten you.\u201d\nStill, I know that Robert hasn\u2019t fully let go of his feelings of worthlessness yet. He\u2019s beginning to accept that his life has value, but there are still years of verbal abuse and manipulation for his heart to overcome.\n\nWhen I was young I used to collect comic books. I would read them with gloves on and seal them in plastic bags to preserve their value. One day my Dad said something to me that I\u2019ll never forget. We were talking about how one of the comics I owned was valued at $200. He smiled and said, \u201cSon, that comic is only worth $200 if you can find some chump who\u2019s got the money and is willing to give it to you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s true. It doesn\u2019t matter what price tag someone puts on an item. The real value of that item is in what someone is willing to pay for it.\n\u201cFor you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.\u201d \u2013 1 Peter 1:18-19\nWhat price was Jesus willing to pay for you to be with Him? How much worth do you have to Him? According to His Word, you are worth suffering for, and bleeding for, and dieing for.\n\u201cYou are not your own; you were bought at a price.\u201d \u2013 1 Cor 6:19-20\nIn God\u2019s eyes, you are not worthless. You are not stupid. You are not a failure. You are precious beyond measure to the Creator of the Universe and He would rather die than be without you.\n\u201cHow great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!\u201d \u2013 1 John 3:1\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

10,House Church Is NOT The Answer,"April 5, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\n\nYou probably already know that I walked away from pastoral ministry at a traditional church over 11 years ago to start a church that meets in homes around Orange County, California where 100 percent of the offerings go to support the poor in our community. You probably also know that I\u2019ve since moved to Boise, Idaho and started a new house church group here, and may actually start a second one very soon.\n\n\nYou may even know that I\u2019ve written a book called \u201cJesus Unveiled\u201d which is about to be published in a few months, about how God\u2019s design for His Church has always been about people who gather as living stones and where everyone is a priest of God offering themselves as daily, living sacrifices.\xa0\n\nSo, it might be a shock to you that I would say, \u201cHouse Church is not the answer\u201d. But, I am saying it. It\u2019s not the answer.\n\nJesus is the answer. The Gospel of the Kingdom is the answer. Living out the teachings of Christ is the answer.\nWhat counts is simply this: Surrendering to Christ alone as a daily follower of Jesus.\nSo, it\u2019s really not about where you meet on Sunday mornings. It\u2019s more about what happens every other day of your life.\n\n\n\nDoes it matter how you gather? Yes, I\u2019d say it does matter. Especially if you have any real hope of stepping into the awesome reality of having Christ as your functional leader and head in the Church.\n\xa0\nDoes it matter if you submit to a pastoral authority? Yes, I\u2019d say that you shouldn\u2019t do that. Especially if you have any real desire to become a member of the priesthood of all believers and fulfill your calling within the Body of Christ.\n\xa0\nDoes it matter if everyone in the Church has an equal opportunity to speak, and teach, and share, and use the spiritual gifts God has given them? Absolutely! Without this the Church is not a Body at all, according to Paul the Apostle. What makes us a \u201cBody\u201d is when Christ alone is our actual head and when everyone else is working together to share their spiritual gifts for the building up their brothers and sisters in Christ.\n\xa0\nBut gathering in a home won\u2019t cut it. Meeting in a circle and singing songs won\u2019t accomplish anything. Having a great meeting\xa0about\xa0Jesus is not the same thing as having an actual meeting\xa0with Jesus.\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\nHouse church is not the answer. Jesus is. And learning to gather beneath the shadow of His wings, and learning to hear His voice together, and actually encountering the Risen One in the fellowship of other submitted and surrendered believers is what every follower of Christ is made for.\n\xa0\nWhatever you do, please don\u2019t settle for house church. Gather together with Jesus as your only focus, and accept no substitutes.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

11,"No, God Does NOT Despise Anyone","April 4, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that I would even need to post an article to make this point to anyone, especially to other Christians. But, apparently, there are many who actually do believe that God hates the wicked and despises sinners.\nWho? You ask. Well, people like pastor, author and Bible teacher R.C. Sproul, for example.\n\n\nTry to watch this clip below without throwing up. [It wasn\u2019t easy for me].\n\nSo, just to summarize:\n*There\u2019s nothing more dangerous than preaching that God loves people unconditionally.\n*People who hear this message of unconditional love may come to believe that God\u2019s love for them isn\u2019t dependent upon their repentance of sin.\n*Mister Roger\u2019s Neighborhood is better than the Kingdom of God.\n*God loves Christ and then only those who are in Christ [Christians].\n*God abhors [detests] the wicked [Psalm 11:5]\n*God doesn\u2019t send the sin to hell, He sends the sinner to hell.\n*God is angry every day against the wicked [according to the \u201cBiblical Character of God\u201d]\n*Every sinner is exposed to the rage and fury of God every second of every day. [See Romans 1:18]\n*We shouldn\u2019t \u201ctake the terror out of it [the Gospel]\u201d [See 2 Cor. 5:11]\n\n\n*The sinner needs to be terrified about his condition.\n*To bring our nation into righteousness our preaching must dramatically change [to this message of fear/terror].\nGot all that?\nWhere to begin? Well, for one I\u2019d start with Jesus who never told us that God hates the wicked, and who told us that if we\u2019ve seen Him we\u2019ve seen the Father. So, what do we see when we look at Jesus? We see a God who loves sinners and embraces the unrighteous, and shows great compassion on the unwashed and the unholy.\nWe also read in the New Covenant scriptures that God so loved the world that He gave us Jesus: to show us this love, to demonstrate this love, and to teach us to love others in the same way.\nHow does Jesus respond to the sinners who nailed him to a cross? He prayed for their forgiveness even as they were in the act of murdering him.\nHow does Jesus respond when he rises from the dead and returns to face those who crucified him? He breathes \u201cPeace\u201d upon them and reminds them to follow his example of love.\nNext, I\u2019d look at the Apostles. Because, if it is so important and vital to preach the terror of God, and to emphasize the wrath and fury of God before we share the \u201cGood News\u201d, then why is it we never \u2013 not once \u2013 see any of the Apostles preaching about wrath, or fire, or condemnation, or fear?\n\n\nFor example, there are around 6 different sermons preached in the book of the Acts of the Apostles and guess how many of them include references to hell, fire, fear, anger, wrath or fury? [Go ahead, guess].\nNone of them.\nNot a single one.\nIn fact, what we see is that Paul speaks to idol-worshiping pagans in Athens and affirms these truths to them:\n*They are the children of God\n*God loves them and showers them with blessings so that they might turn to Him\n*They are already in God and are sustained by God no matter what they do\n*God wants them to reconsider this information and turn to God\n*God will judge the world in righteousness through Jesus Christ, whom He raised from the dead\nNow, I get it: That phrase \u201cJudge the world\u201d is in there, so that must be the \u201cfear\u201d and the \u201cwrath\u201d part, right?\nWell, if so, it doesn\u2019t seem to have created much fear in his listeners. In fact, the only reaction to any of this is related to his statement about the resurrection from the dead, not to the world being judged in righteousness.\nPaul doesn\u2019t mention sin, or hell, or eternal conscious torment. He mentions a God who created us, cares for us, wants us to turn to Him, and who sustains us in every way \u2013 regardless of our condition towards Him.\n\n\nThat\u2026sorta seems like\u2026unconditional love\u2026.doesn\u2019t it?\n[And yes, Paul does mention the word \u201crepent\u201d in his sermon to the Athenians, but that word in the Greek is literally about re-thinking our position, not about being sorry for our sins].",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2019/04/no-god-does-not-despise-anyone/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
12,No Bible? Know Christ.,"April 1, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nEvery single time I try to point out that the Bible never points us to the Bible, but always points us to Christ, and that we can know Christ without the Bible, someone always says this:\n\u201cBut, Keith, you wouldn\u2019t know anything about Christ without the Bible.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s the problem, I think.\n\n\nSee, people who have made the menu the meal, or confused the map with the treasure, cannot understand that there\u2019s someone beyond the written words ABOUT Jesus and the realization that those written words are telling you to have an experience WITH Jesus.\nSo, my usual response to this statement that \u201cWe can\u2019t know anything about Jesus without the Bible\u201d is this:\nIf I came to your house and took every Bible away from you, would you have no connection to Christ?\nSadly, for many Christians, the answer would be \u201cYes,\u201d but I suspect for many of them the answer is actually \u201cNo.\u201d\nSee, we read about Jesus and learn information about Jesus from the Bible, certainly. But, once we actually encounter Christ and become filled with the Holy Spirit, then [according to the Bible, and to actual experience] we begin to KNOW Christ and the Father in a more real, intimate way.\nDoes that mean we don\u2019t need the Bible? Does that mean we toss it out? Or stop reading it?\nNever.\nBut, what it does mean is this: We stop trying to make the menu the meal and we start feasting on the Bread of Life and the Living Water that we receive daily through our vital connection with Christ.\n\n\nIf this is hard for you to grasp, there\u2019s a very good chance you have not truly understood those words that you\u2019ve read in that Book.\nThis is why I keep trying to explain this to my brothers and sisters in Christ. I\u2019m not trying to diminish the Bible. Far from it. I\u2019m trying to do what the Bible does: Elevate Christ!\nJesus is the Word of God. Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us. Jesus abides in us as we abide in Christ.\nWe are called to know Christ in an intimate way that goes way beyond mere information and that truly inspires transformation from within.\nNo book can do that for you. It may tell you that it\u2019s possible, but you have to move beyond the idea and step into the reality.\nTry it.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

13,Sorry Christians: Our Bible Contains Fake Letters From Paul (And Peter),"March 29, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nI hope you\u2019re sitting down. Maybe grab a stress ball or cuddle with your therapy dog.\nReady? Ok. Here goes.\nThe New Testament is filled with epistles that were not written by Paul or Peter. These are called \u201cPseudepigrapha\u201d because, like other fake scriptures circulated in the late second and third centuries, they were not authored by the Apostle whose name appears on it.\n\n\nThe textbook definition of Pseudepigrapha is:\n\u201cSpurious or pseudonymous writings ascribed to various biblical patriarchs and prophets but composed within approximately 200 years of the birth of Jesus Christ.\u201d\nIn other words, the New Testament you\u2019re holding contains \u201cscriptures\u201d that are about as reliable as The Gospel of Thomas, The Epistle of Barnabus, or The Book of Enoch [which the New Testament book of Jude quotes, by the way].\nSorry to break it to you like this, but there was no other way.\nYou need to know the truth.\nSo, which books of the New Testament are Pseudepigrapha and how did they get in there?\nGreat questions! Let\u2019s take the first one:\nSeveral letters bearing Paul\u2019s name are disputed among scholars, namely:\n\nEphesians\nColossians\n2 Thessalonians\n1 Timothy\n2 Timothy\nTitus\n\nScholars are sharply divided on whether or not Colossians and 2 Thessalonians are genuine, but when it comes to Ephesians and the so-called \u201cPastoral Epistles\u201d [that would be\xa01 and 2 Timothy, and Titus] most critical scholars have no trouble labeling them as pseudepigraphical works.\nI know. It\u2019s hard to take. Breathe deep.\nAre you ready for more?\nNo one knows who wrote either 1 Peter or 2 Peter, but the one thing every scholar agrees on is this: It wasn\u2019t the Apostle Peter.\nOuch.\nBut, the good news is that we do have seven undisputed letters from Paul that were accepted and included in nearly every early Christian canon, including the first by Marcion.\nThose are:\n\nRomans\nFirst Corinthians\nSecond Corinthians\nGalatians\nPhilippians\nFirst Thessalonians\nPhilemon\n\n\n\nOk, so on to the second question: \u201cHow did these fake letters from Peter and Paul end up in our Bibles?\u201d\nWell, that\u2019s easy: Because the Christians who decided which books were in or out of the Canon \u2013 around 400 AD \u2013 didn\u2019t make their decisions using textual criticism. Usually, the decision was made by consensus, or based on opinions.\nIn fact, in some cases, they just prayed and waited for God to move the scrolls that were not authentic on to the floor. [Nope. I\u2019m not making that up].\nStill other decisions about the Canon, like the Council of Trent [1546] were nearly too close to call,\xa0 with 24 yea, 15 nay and 16 abstaining. So, it could\u2019ve gone another way, I suppose.\nMaybe a better question is: \u201cWhy do some Bible scholars today doubt these letters of Paul and Peter?\u201d\nThis could take a long time. So, if you\u2019re really interested in the gory details, I\u2019d recommend Googling \u201cDisputed Letters of Paul\u201d or \u201cPeter\u201d and start heading down the rabbit hole.\nFor the rest of you, here\u2019s the short answer:\nSummary of reasons to doubt Pauline authorship of Ephesians:\n\nThe language and style are different. Ephesians contains 40 new words, e.g. 1:3 \u201cheavenly places\u201d; \u201cfamily, or fatherhood\u201d (3:15). 1:19 has four different words for \u201cpower\u201d\nEphesians and Colossians use a different word for \u201creconcile\u201d from Paul\u2019s word (Col 1:20, 22; Eph 2:16).\nEphesians is similar to Colossians at many places. Eph has 155 verses, 73 of which are similar to ones from Col: e.g. Eph 4:1-2 \u2248 Col 3:12-13, Eph 5:19-20 \u2248 Col 3:16-17, Eph 6:21-22 \u2248 Col 4:7-8.\nEphesians takes many key ideas from Colossians. Wisdom, mystery. The word of truth. Gospel of salvation. Saints of God.\nEphesians also refers to most of the other letters of Paul. In many ways it seems like a summary of Paul\u2019s ideas, written by a disciple of his, and brought up to date for the Church of his own time.\nMetaphors, or illustrations in Paul are turned into actual objective realities in Ephesians (and sometimes in Colossians also). E.g. faith, gospel, word of God, reconciliation, salvation, human resurrection and glorification, the Church as the Body of Christ, Minister, Saints of God.\nEphesians shows that the Church is becoming an advanced and powerful universal institution (rather like the Church today). In Paul\u2019s time there was no universal Church in that sense, but only informal gatherings of individual believing communities.\nEphesians contains no mention of charismatic gifts.\nEphesians shows Jesus acting on his own account and by his own authority without making explicit that he is acting on God\u2019s behalf and with God\u2019s blessing; in Paul\u2019s other letters, this is more explicit.\n\n\n\nSummary of reasons to doubt Pauline authorship of Colossians:\n\nThe basis for the early objection was that the letter aimed at refuting\xa0Gnosticism, a heresy which had not reached its ascendancy until the early 2nd century.\nAnother argument centers on differences in style and vocabulary with significant stylistic differences between Colossians and Paul\u2019s other works, such as unusual\xa0genitive\xa0constructions.\nThe extensive theological development in the epistle compared to other epistles has also led to skepticism concerning Pauline authorship.\n\nSummary of reasons to doubt Pauline authorship of 2 Thessalonians:\n\nMuch of the dispute concerns the linguistic similarity between\xa01 Thessalonians\xa0and\xa02 Thessalonians. For example, 1 Thess 2:9 is almost identical to 2 Thess 3:8.\nReflects knowledge of the synoptic gospels, which, according to the current scholarly consensus, had not been written when Paul wrote his epistles.\nActually makes the specific claim not to be a forgery, which is a typical claim of forgers at the time.\nThe\xa0eschatology of each letter to the Thessalonians is considerably different.\n\n\n\nSummary of reasons to doubt the Pastoral Epistles of Paul:\n\nMarcion\u2019s canon [the earliest of all] does not include them and there is no evidence he had ever heard of them\nThe vocabulary and phraseology used in the Pastorals is often at variance with that of the other epistles.\nOver 1/3 of the vocabulary is not used anywhere else in the Pauline epistles, and over 1/5 is not used anywhere else in the New Testament, while 2/3 of the non-Pauline vocabulary are used by 2nd-century Christian writers.\n\n\n\nSummary of reasons to doubt that Peter wrote 1 Peter:\n\nThe language, dating, style, and structure of the letter has led many scholars to doubt its authenticity.\nThe writer appears to have had a formal education in rhetoric and philosophy, and an advanced knowledge of the Greek language,\xa0none of which would be usual for a Galilean fisherman.\nThe letter lacks all reference to any personal details regarding the historical Jesus of Nazareth.\nThe author references the Septuagint translation which would\u2019ve been an unlikely source for historical Peter to reference.\n\n\n\nSummary of reasons to doubt that Peter wrote 2 Peter:\n\nThe second epistle of Peter identifies the author as Peter but uses a different spelling than 1 Peter and the rest of the New Testament.\n\xa0There are significant linguistic differences from 1 Peter\nThe author references the book of Jude\nThe epistles makes allusions to\xa02nd-century gnosticism\nThe letter encourages the church in the wake of a delayed Second Coming of Christ.\nThe letter has the weakest amount of scholarly and external support than any other New Testament epistle.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Your Bible is chock-full of pseudepigrapha.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that these books should be removed from the Canon. Nor does it suggest that they are not inspired by the Holy Spirit.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t know who wrote Ephesians or Colossians, but I can affirm that whoever did so was quite inspired by the Holy Spirit and very much enlightened as to the nature and character of Christ.\nI\u2019m less convinced of any inspiration when it comes to the Pastoral Epistles, however, and I\u2019m not sure yet where I stand on 1 or 2 Peter.\nThe question of inspiration and authority is, in itself, a serious problem for most Christians. We tend to place more authority on the Bible rather than on Christ, even though Christ [in the Bible] tells us that \u201call authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me [Christ].\u201d (See Matt. 28:18)\n\n\nWhat we have to do is to learn how to abide in Christ and to know the voice of the Good Shepherd so clearly that we know inspired truth when we hear it, regardless of where it comes from.\nEven the most famous verse in the Pseudepigraphal book of 2 Timothy says that \u201call the God-breathed writings [graphis] are profitable for teaching, instruction, rebuke and training in righteousness.\u201d [2 Tim. 3:16]\nThe trick is to learn which writings are God-breathed and which are not.\nHow do we do that? Well\u2026\n\u201cTheir minds were made dull, for to this day\xa0the same\xa0veil\xa0remains when\xa0the\xa0old covenant is read. It has not been\xa0removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.\u201d [2 Cor. 3:14]\n\u201cBut we have the mind of Christ.\u201d [1 Cor. 2:16]\n\u201cMy sheep hear my voice, and they follow me and I know them.\u201d [John 10: 27-28]\nLet\u2019s learn to lean on Christ and not on what others have said about Christ.\n\u201cYou search the Scriptures because you think that in them you will find life. Yet you refuse to come to me to find life.\u201d [John 5:39-40]\n\n\nThe more we abide in Christ and the more Christ abides in us, the easier it will be to discern the voice of God.\nOur authority is Christ, and Christ alone.\nDo you agree?\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

14,How Do We Heal Our Political Divide?,"March 27, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\nAs American Christians pledge allegiance to the flag, we are increasingly aware that our churches are not united as one, but are deeply divided along political lines.\nThe facts are alarming.\n\nOur Churches are becoming\xa0more politically-charged.\nPolitical divisions have created a\xa0fractured and broken\xa0Church community.\nYoung people are\xa0leaving the church\xa0by the thousands.\nMost young people say politics in the pulpit is\xa0driving them away\xa0from Christianity.\n\n\n\nBottom Line: The American Church has never been more divided politically.\xa0\nSo, what can we do to reverse this disturbing trend?\nWell, maybe we can get together and talk about it.\nAt least, that\u2019s my hope.\nThis summer, I\u2019m planning to travel to different Churches around the country to hold town-hall style meetings where we can examine the issues that divide us, explore the dangers of mixing faith and politics and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 identify a path to heal our divided Church and find common ground again.\nThese events are forming even now. You can see what we\u2019ve got in mind here.\nFor me, there really is no greater problem in the American Church right now. The numbers are alarming, but the devastation caused by our division is even worse.\nNot only are Church communities dividing sharply with one another over political arguments, but even families are being torn apart over these issues.\nIt goes so much deeper than unfriending a stranger on Facebook or unfollowing someone on Twitter. We have actually started to sever our connections with people we share a last name with, or people we would otherwise lay down and die for.\n\n\nTo me, this is a form of psychosis. We\u2019ve allowed our allegiances to politicians and political ideologies to cloud our thinking, and to curse our neighbors and our brothers and sisters in Christ.\nIn the words of Paul the Apostle: \u201cThis ought not to be\u201d\nWhen Paul rebuked the Christians in Corinth for dividing like this, it was because they were forming tribes over which Apostle was their favorite.\nToday\u2019s Churches are dividing over a much less noble allegiance, and I believe the response should be the same:\n\u201cOne of you says, \u2018I follow Trump\u2019, another \u2018I follow Pelosi\u2019, another \u2018I follow McConnell\u2019 and still another \u2018I follow Bernie.\u2019\xa0\xa0Is Christ divided? Was Donald crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Hilary?\u201d\nBut, as dangerous and destructive as this political division is to the Body of Christ, very few seem to be standing for unity. Very few seem to call out for an end to this. Almost no one seems to decry this way of thinking, and most are rushing to defend their position and contend that Christ is on their side.\nSo, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to do something. Maybe it\u2019s naive. Maybe it\u2019s foolish. Maybe no one will be interested in coming together to seek common ground and to heal our political divide.\n\n\n\n\nBut, I have to believe that someone, somewhere, feels the same way. Someone, somewhere, sees how this is killing the Church. Someone, somewhere, must be eager to abandon the defense of politics and take up the mandate to love our neighbor as ourselves.\nIf you\u2019re that someone, please let me know. I\u2019d love to help sow seeds of unity and peace in the Body of Christ.\nThe time to heal this wound is now. We may not have another chance.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

15,An Appeal To Optimistic Christianity,"March 26, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nI\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m a pessimist at heart. There\u2019s a phrase I love that says \u201cThe definition of a Pessimist is: An Optimist with experience.\u201d\nThat\u2019s my basic posture.\nBut, as I\u2019ve been doing research for my next book, I ran across a beautiful description of the early Christians that really took my breath away and made me reconsider my pessimistic tendencies.\n\n\nIn the book, \u201cUniversalism: The Prevailing Doctrine of the Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years\u201d by J.W. Hanson, there\u2019s a quote from another book [\u201cUniversalism Asserted\u201d], which says:\n\u201cThe church was born into a world whose moral rottenness few have \u2013 or can have \u2013 any idea. Even the sober historians of the later Roman Empire have their pages tainted with scenes impossible to translate: Lusts the foulest, debauchery to us happily inconceivable, raged on every side. [And so] to assert even faintly the final redemption of all this rottenness, whose depths we dare not try to sound, required the firmest faith in the larger hope, as an essential part of the Gospel. But this is not all; in a peculiar sense the church was militant in the early centuries. It ws engaged in, at times, a struggle for life or death, with a relentless persecution. Thus it must have seen in that age almost an act of treason to the cross to teach that, though dying unrepentant, the bitter persecutor, or the votary of abominable lusts, should yet in the ages to come find salvation.\u201d\nHe goes on to note:\n\u201cThe early fathers wrote when the wild beasts of the arena tore alike the innocent and the guilty, limb from limb, amid the applause even of gently-nurtured women\u2026they wrote when every minister of justice was a torturer\u2026when every household of the better class \u2013 even among Christians \u2013 swarmed with slaves liable to torture, to scourging, to mutilation, at the caprice of a master or the frown of a mistress. Let all these facts be fully weighed, and a conviction arises irresistibly, that, in such an age, no idea of Universalism could have originated unless inspired from above.\u201d\n\n\nHis point here is that the concept of universal redemption was not something taught by the Old Covenant scriptures, nor was it taught by the Pagan religions surrounding them, or is it something that resides in the heart of man naturally \u2013 the idea that the most evil and hateful among us should receive the beautiful mercy of Christ. And yet\u2026\nAnd yet this teaching WAS found in many, many of the ancient Christian\u2019s writings. So, he [Hanson] asks:\n\u201cWhere, then, did they find it? [This extravagant mercy] Whence did they import this idea? Can we doubt that the fathers could only have drawn it, as their writings testify, from the Bible itself?\u201d\nNow, in addition to this radical idea of universal reconciliation, the author also points out another inspirational feature of the early Church: Their invincible joy and optimism.\nAs the book points out:\n\u201cThe first Christians regarded the grave as the doorway into a better world, and expressed only hope and trust in their emblems and inscriptions.\u201d\nSpecifically, as evidenced by several hundred years worth of inscriptions found in the catacombs, the author notes that their views about life in Christ were most clearly exemplified in the ways they spoke about death; at a time when they should have been most sorrowful and negative; and yet what we see instead of a focus on darkness and suffering and loss is an almost uni-vocal testimony to an unfathomable cheerfulness.\n\n\nAs he notes:\n\u201cThe fathers of the church live in their voluminous works; [but] the lower orders [common Christians] are only represented by these simple records [found in the catacombs], from which, with scarcely an exception, sorrow and complaint are banished; the boast of suffering, or an appeal to the less revengeful passions is nowhere to be found. One expresses faith, another hope, a third charity. The genius of primitive Christianity \u2013 to believe, to love and to suffer \u2013 has never been better illustrated\u2026in all the pictures and scriptures of our Lord\u2019s history, no reference is ever found to his sufferings or death. No gloomy subjects occur in the cycle of Christian art.\u201c\nAnd another scholar quoted agrees, saying:\n\u201cTo the early Christians, Christ was living; the one agonized hour [on the cross] was lost in the thought of his glory and triumph. The fall of theology and Christian thought dates from the error of dwelling upon his death instead of his life.\u201d [Ruskin]\nAnd speaking of these earliest Christians, New Testament scholar Farrar adds:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a religion of joy and not of gloom, of life and not death, of tenderness and not severity.\u201d\nAs I read these words, I began to grieve over what the Christian church has become today. I began to long for us to return to those infant years where we were delighted by the life of Christ and easily cheered by mere association with Him. It made me recall the words of our Lord when He said:\n\u201cUnless you become like little children, you will not enter the Kingdom of God.\u201d [Matt. 18:3]\nMaybe we need to go back as a Church and once again discover the simple joys of knowing Christ. Maybe we need to abandon our fears of tomorrow, and our arguments about theology; maybe we need to remember what it was like to delight ourselves in the sweetness and goodness of God.\nIt makes me wonder: What if Christianity were more like this today? What if, whenever anyone thought of Christianity, they couldn\u2019t help but picture a people who personified child-like humility? What if we were known for our unshakable love? What if the words \u201cJoy\u201d and \u201cLife\u201d were more synonymous with those who identify as Christians?\n\n\nI can\u2019t help but think that these are the same questions that are \u2013 even know \u2013 ringing in the ears of Our Lord and beating in time with His own heart for us.\nI long for a more optimistic, happy and joyful Church. I\u2019m so tired of the fear-mongering; the judging; the tribalism, and the division.\nAren\u2019t you? Aren\u2019t you ready for a brand new form of Christianity that is full of life and hope? Aren\u2019t you eager to embrace a Christianity that reflects the joyful face of Jesus to the world?\nWe already have so much darkness. More than enough anger. Way too much fear.\nBring on the joy. Let loose the love.

16,Stop Trying To Fix People. Just Love Them.,"March 22, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nSo\u2026I had a dream last night. It was kinda strange, but I woke up wondering what it meant.\nPart of it was someone looking at me and urging me to \u201cbe the scientist\u201d I was meant to be.\nThere was a bit about trying to tune a radio to find a station but it never would come in.\n\n\nThen we were walking through the forest, up a hill. Someone was asking me if I was a Prophet or an Apostle. I started explaining how I might be a little one or the other, but I wasn\u2019t sure.\nThere was another bit where a friend and I went into a little child\u2019s playhouse and sat in this balcony overlooking a yard, almost like a hidden tree house thing. She started \xa0doing this little dot-dash pattern on a writing tablet or book as if she was trying to help me figure out what my gifts or calling were.\nLike I said, weird.\nBut, then it got weirder. This morning on the train I\u2019m reading the next chapter of this book, \u201cThe Cure\u201d, by John Lynch, and I come across this part:\n\u201cSome of the most disingenuous and useless relationships are those where one has an agenda in another\u2019s life, seeing ourselves as SCIENTISTS seeking a solution for disease in a twisted lab experiment. These people assume some equation of holiness: Four hours of small group study plus thirty minutes memorizing scriptures, multiplied by challenge, conviction and demand make the subject sin less and become a more productive church member.\u201d\n\n\nHow did I dream about something I hadn\u2019t read yet?\nBut honestly the whole chapter started to make me wonder if what I\u2019ve been trying to do is to come up with some agenda where I can \u201cfix\u201d people. And maybe all I really need to do is to just help people understand that they are loved? That they can really open themselves up to be loved by us and by God and by others?\nLater on this same chapter it says:\n\u201cThe spiritually immature are not loved well, but it is not because they fail. They are not loved well because they fail to trust the love of another. Because they trust no one, their needs aren\u2019t met. Because their needs aren\u2019t met, they live out of selfishness. Not only do they not receive love, they don\u2019t give it either.\u201d\nI wonder if this is really our core issue? Do we fail to respond to God\u2019s love because we don\u2019t really trust that we are lovable?\nDo we keep ourselves walled off from others because we don\u2019t trust that we will be loved if people really knew all about us?\n\n\nDo we shut ourselves off from God, and from others, because in our heart of hearts we\u2019re just not convinced we are worth loving, or that if others knew us deeply that we would still be deeply loved?\nMaybe so.\nAnd if so, then maybe the cure is to start learning how to really receive God\u2019s love. As it says in 1 John: \u201cWe love because He first loved us.\u201d Not simply chronologically. It\u2019s like a catalyst: We only know how to love because we have first received His love that transcends knowledge.\nOnce we really begin to believe that we are loved, and that His love won\u2019t stop or change or go away if we screw up, then we begin to be changed by His love. It starts to transform us from within. We relax. We discover the freedom to be who we really are. We suddenly realize our masks are obsolete. We drop them on the ground, or absently forget them under the chair, as we start to laugh, and sing, and dance and enjoy being loved!\nWe finally start to believe it \u2013 really, really BELIEVE \u2013 that WE ARE LOVED!\nOnce we fully accept and trust that we are loved by God \u2013 forever, without fluctuation or conditions \u2013 then we experience the glorious freedom of being His Beloved in the here and now.\n\n\nThat\u2019s when we have the best hope of helping others to break free of their chains and begin to believe that they, too, are loved beyond measure.\nIt\u2019s a process, but we\u2019re all made to be loved, and to love others, so the more we begin to move in this direction and to trust our Abba, the easier it all becomes to us. Soon, what sounds strange to our ears is the idea that we\u2019re unworthy, or broken, or sinful, or that we\u2019re full of darkness. Our hearts refuse to hear it. Our heads shake back and forth as our lips whisper: \u201cNot anymore we\u2019re not!\u201d\nWe reach a point where we fully accept our identity as \u201cthe one the Lord loves\u201d and our lives become re-calibrated to a new rhythm and pattern of being: We are the children of God. We are the one\u2019s He loves. We are being transformed daily into His image. Christ is alive in us and He will never, ever leave.\nHalleluiah!\nSo, I\u2019m giving up on trying to be a \u201cScientist\u201d who wants to \u201cfix people\u201d. My calling is to be one who proclaims the Good News that they are dearly loved of God and that if they put their hope in Jesus, He will show them how to be loved by God and how to love others out of that glorious relationship.\n\n\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

17,What\u2019s Wrong With New Covenant Theology?,"March 21, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nNew Covenant Theology was the \u201cnew thing\u201d a few decades ago and many were called heretics for defending and promoting it.\nPreviously, the two main theologies were Covenant Theology and Dispensationalism.\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\u201cNew Covenant Theology (teaches) that the person and work of Jesus Christ is the central focus of the Bible. One distinctive result of this is that Old Testament Laws have been abrogated or cancelled with Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, and replaced with the Law of Christ found in the New Covenant.\u201d\nThis view also says that:\n\n\n\u201cThe New Testament interpret(s) the Old Testament\u2026when the NT interprets an OT promise\xa0differently\xa0than the plain reading, then New Covenant Theology concludes that\xa0that\xa0is how God interprets His promise.\u201d\xa0\n\n\u201cAs an example, Amos 9:11-12 is quoted by James in Acts 15 and\xa0is interpreted by him to associate the rebuilding of \u201cDavid\u2019s fallen tent\u201d with the Gentiles\u2019 salvation. This would be a highly surprising interpretation to the Jewish believers, since there is no precedent for it to be interpreted as anything other than a promise to the nation of Israel. (Instead), New Covenant Theology says that God has given us His interpretation of that passage, through James.\u201d\nAs for me, New Covenant Theology has been my own personal perspective on scripture for a while now. Most of what I have written here on my blog, and in my various books, has been from this perspective.\nBut lately, my theology has started to progress a bit further than this.\nI embraced New Covenant Theology because it affirmed that the Flat Bible perspective is flawed and reorients scripture with Christ as our ultimate authority. But unfortunately it stops short of allowing Jesus to fully reform our ideas about God.\n\n\nSo, while New Covenant Theology (NCT) affirms Christ as the center of scripture, it fails to completely embrace Jesus as our one and only image of who the Father is and what He is really like.\nWhere NCT falters is in fully admitting that the revelation of the Father found in Jesus is often at odds with what the Old Covenant prophets have to say about Him.\nFurthermore, the NCT position also fails to admit that the prophets themselves are often at odds with one another about what God said and what God\u2019s character is like. [See, for example the differing statements made in the OT scriptures about whether God did, or did not, command the Israelites to offer animal sacrifices].\nTo help explain this, let me borrow an analogy. There are various answers to the question \u201cWhere do babies come from?\u201d and someone might say \u201cthe stork brings them\u201d and another might say \u201cwhen mommy and daddy love each other very much the baby starts to grow in her tummy\u201d and still another might say \u201cthe male contributes the sperm which he secretes during sexual intercourse to fertilize the egg which the woman provides and in 9 months the embryo matures into a fetus and a child is born.\u201d\n\n\nTwo of those answers might be considered \u201ctrue\u201d, one of them is obviously a story designed to symbolize the reality without actually addressing any of the mechanics, and yet all of them are still an attempt to answer the question about where babies come from.\nThis is similar to what we have in the Hebrew Bible when it comes to question of what God is like. Some voices give us the \u201cstork\u201d version of the story, with great symbolism and hyperbole. Some voices give us an approximation of the answer. Other voices may give us more detailed and specific answers that more closely align with reality.\nFor us, Jesus is the reality. He is \u201cthe exact representation\u201d of the Father. He is the one in whom \u201cthe fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form.\u201d He is \u201cthe Word made flesh who dwelt among us.\u201d\nSo, the best picture of the Father is found in Christ. If we have \u201cseen Him,\u201d we have truly and accurately \u201cseen the Father\u201d in the most complete and full way possible.\nBecause \u201cno one has ever seen God\u201d except Jesus and the reason He came was to reveal the Father to us like no one else before ever could, or did.\n\n\nIn our analogy, David the Psalmist might be one who provides the more poetic \u201cstork version\u201d of the Father\u2019s character. Isaiah and Jeremiah might be the \u201cmommy loves daddy\u201d version of the story. But only Christ gives us the version of the story that includes every specific detail we need to fully understand who the Father is and what the Father is like.\n\n\nAs long as we insist upon holding tightly to the rigid inerrancy of the Old Testament scriptures, we will forever be kept from fully embracing the clearest and most accurate portrayal of who God really is.\nUntil we relax our grip on the idea that the Old Testament prophets were truly seeing God clearly and recognize that the Abba Father we see revealed in Christ overrides those limited and flawed perspectives of God, we will remain confused about who God really is.\nAs long as we allow the tarnished testimony of Moses to describe God as one who commands His people to slaughter infants and toddlers without showing compassion, we will forever stand in opposition to the testimony of Jesus who showed us an Abba Father God who loves children, cares for His enemies, shows compassion to the broken and commands us to do the same \u2013 specifically because this is who He is and what He is like. [See Matt. 5:44-45]\n\n\nSo, even as those who stood up and defended the New Covenant Theology view a few decades ago were considered heretics and false teachers by the Dispensationalists and Covenant Theology teachers of their day, we should not be surprised when the same charge is leveled at those of us who affirm a Jesus-centric perspective of Scripture today.\nUltimately I believe it simply boils down to this: Who is our authority? Is it the Bible? Or is it Christ? Do we center our theology on a book, or on a person who is indeed God Himself incarnate?\nThe Book, as wonderful as it may be, is imperfect. It contains the testimony of men who sometimes saw clearly and sometimes did not. The Book contains the voices of men who don\u2019t always agree with one another about who God is and what God is like.\nOur choice is simple: We either agree with Jesus about who God is, because He is God made flesh, or we side with those Old Testament prophets who were not perfect, not flawless and not Emmanuel [God with us].\nI choose Jesus.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

18,Loving The Sinner: An Unpopular Mercy,"March 20, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nDoes everyone deserve love? Does everyone receive mercy?\nIn some contexts, we can freely affirm these ideas. Of course everyone deserves to be loved. Certainly everyone receives God\u2019s mercy and forgiveness, regardless of who they are or what they\u2019ve done.\nIt\u2019s the vagueness of these ideals that allows us to affirm them. But give us someone specific and these start to break down.\n\n\nFor example: The man who walked into a Mosque in New Zealand and shot 50 people dead \u2013 some of them small children \u2013 does this man deserve to be loved? Should we seek to show mercy to this person? Would we rejoice to see him sincerely repent and confess his sins? Would we gladly extend this man forgiveness and mercy?\nProbably not.\nBut, this is where true love and actual mercy must be applied, or we\u2019re just blowing smoke about the power of God\u2019s love, mercy and grace.\nEither we believe that everyone truly deserves to be loved \u2013 not only by God, but also by those of us who claim to follow Christ \u2013 or we must admit that we are selective about who does and does not deserve to be loved and shown mercy.\nWe have to take Jesus seriously when he says things like this:\n\u201cIf you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them!\xa0And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit? Even sinners do that much!\u2026Love your enemies! Do good to them. Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked.\xa0\xa0You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.\u201d (Luke 6:32-38)\n\n\nOur love should be outlandish, even scandalous, if it is to mirror the sort of love Jesus speaks of here.\nThis kind of love will be unpopular. It might get us in trouble. We may lose friends over it. People might hate us fiercely for loving people who are evil, and showing mercy to sinners who do not deserve it.\nBut, that\u2019s what mercy means: Showing kindness and favor to those who do not deserve it.\nIf they deserved kindness and favor, then we would call that \u201cJustice\u201d; because this was how they should have been treated, but were not.\nMercy is another level. It\u2019s showing kindness, favor and compassion to someone who by definition does NOT deserve any of those things.\nWe all love mercy when it\u2019s coming our direction. If I screw up, hurt someone, end up in prison, receive the just penalty for my sins; this is justice. I deserve all of that. But, if the Judge decides to show me mercy, throws out my case, dismisses my charges and says \u201cyou\u2019re free to go\u201d, that is a beautiful act of mercy.\nI would praise God for this mercy if it were being shown to me, or to my children, or someone I love who\xa0was being given a second chance.\n\n\nMercy, when it is directed at me, is beautiful.\nBut when mercy is given to someone else; someone who killed innocent people; someone who acted selfishly or hatefully; someone who \u2013 by definition \u2013 does NOT deserve such mercy, I am not typically very quick to rejoice, or to praise God, or to celebrate the beauty of mercy.\nOn the contrary, I am usually quick to cry foul and to demand justice. In those cases, I am not a fan of mercy.\nMaybe we need to rethink this verse which says:\n\u201cHe has shown you, O man, what is good, and what is required of you: To do justice, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.\u201d (Micah 6:8)\nNotice, we are to \u201cdo justice\u201d but we are to \u201clove mercy.\u201d\nLoving mercy is much harder than doing justice.\nSo, this has been on my heart lately. Last Friday evening, after the shooting in New Zealand, we had an opportunity to share a meal with our Muslim neighbors. During that time, we observed a moment of silence together in remembrance of those who had lost their lives. That was when, for a brief instant, the face of the killer popped into my mind. I wondered, \u201cWho will show this man mercy? Who will teach this man about forgiveness and love?\u201d\n\n\nAlmost no one would want to visit this man in jail to see how he\u2019s doing. Almost no one would care to pray for him, or take the time to show him the kind of love that might transform his heart and bring him to a place of sincere repentance.\nNo one except Jesus, and those who put his words into practice.\nBut this is what Jesus expects of us, I believe. His message to us about loving those who do not show us love in return is clear. We should love this way specifically because God loves this way.\nWhen we love this way, we are most like our Heavenly Father who sends rain on the just and the unjust.\nDoes this man who killed Muslims in New Zealand deserve love? Does he deserve to be shown mercy?\nNo, he does not deserve to be loved because of what he did; but he does deserve love\xa0in spite of it.\nLove does not excuse our evils, but love is also not changed by it either.\n\n\nIf love really is our only hope \u2013 and I do believe it is \u2013 then this love of Christ must extend to even the worst of sinners, even to the most despicable people we can think of, or it\u2019s empty and worthless to all of us.\nPlease understand: I am not in any way excusing the horrific actions of this murderer. It makes me sick to think of what sort of person could possibly do such an evil thing. I hate what he did and I mourn for those who have suffered because of his vile actions.\n\n\nLet me be clear: I am not saying this man should be set free. Mercy would not be served by ignoring his crimes. He certainly must endure the penalties that correspond to his horrible actions. However, justice and mercy may work hand-in-hand to bring about his ultimate transformation.\nBut, if I cannot find it in my heart to offer even a small prayer of mercy for this broken and twisted individual; if I cannot imagine God\u2019s love extending even to this person\u2019s darkened soul, then what good is this love for me? Or for you? For anyone?\nThat night at the Peace Feast, when we bowed our heads in silence, I did \u2013 just for a moment \u2013 whisper a prayer of mercy for this horribly evil person whose mind has been twisted by hate; and I wished for just an instant that the transformative love of Christ might obliterate his darkness and reveal to him the magnitude of the crime he had committed against humanity and against God. For a second I had a fleeting hope that, one day, this man might be brought to his knees under the weight of his own sin and cry out desperately for mercy\u2026and for that moment I sincerely hoped that he might receive it.\nMake no mistake: What he did will always be evil. It will always be wrong. But it is wrong specifically because it is contrary to the law of love.\n\n\nLove says we are all one. Love says we are all the children of God. Love says we do not hate one another. Love says we do not kill one another.\nLove also says, we must extend grace and mercy \u2013 and offer forgiveness \u2013 to those who do not yet deserve such things, but who most certainly demonstrate their poverty for such treasures.\nWe don\u2019t heal the darkness with more darkness. We don\u2019t spread love by holding it back from those who need it the most.\nLove is not easy. But it is the only thing that will ever heal us, or save us, or make us one.\n\u201cLove keeps no record of wrongs. Love covers over a multitude of sins. Love never fails.\u201d\xa0\nDo we believe this?\nCertainly, we ourselves need this to be true. But if it\u2019s true for us, then it must be true for everyone. Or it\u2019s not true for anyone.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

19,Peace Feast: Breaking Bread With Our Muslim Neighbors,"March 15, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nEarlier this week, my wife Wendy and I responded to an RSVP to attend a local \u201cPeace Feast\u201d where Christians and Muslims are invited to come together and share a meal in hopes of building relationships and forging a path to understanding and peace.\nThe meal is scheduled for this evening, only a few hours after the news that a white supremacist went into a Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand and shot 49 people to death, wounding dozens more.\n\n\nSo, our conversations tonight will be overshadowed by this tragedy, and our need to find hope, and forgiveness, and healing is more essential than ever before.\nAt this moment, I cannot think of anything more I can say to my Muslim neighbors than, \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d\nMy hope is that we can hold hands, bow our heads, and pray together for unity and peace to flood the hearts and minds of Christians and Muslims during this time of grieving and pain.\nWords are useless now. Only simple, honest and sincere acts of kindness and repentance matter. Our only hope is love. Our only path is forgiveness. Our only future is together.\nAs long as we remain divided, we will suffer violence like this. People from both sides will continue to kindle hatred in their hearts for \u201cthe other\u201d as long as we maintain this posture of \u201cUs vs Them.\u201d\nTribalism is what is what is killing us. Only the breaking down of these walls will allow us to see one another -not as Christians, or as Muslims \u2013 but as people who are made in the image of God and dearly loved by our Abba Father.\nWe are brothers and sisters with one another simply because we share the same lineage: We are all children of God.\n\n\nNone of us is more loved, or less loved by our Father. God loves every one of us the same. And like any Good Father, God\u2019s heart is broken whenever his children harm one another; especially if they do so using his Name.\n\u201cGod is love. Those who live in love also live in God, and God lives in them.\u201d (1 John 4:16)\nOur mission is to love God, and to love others as God has loved us. So, let me ask you: How has God loved you?\nTake some time. Think about this. Count all the beautiful ways that God has loved you. Make a list. Meditate on this great, beautiful and bountiful love that God has lavished upon you.\nGot it? Now, let us begin to love others in this very same way. No matter whether those \u201cothers\u201d dress differently, pray differently, speak differently, worship differently, or otherwise do anything and everything differently than we do. None of that really matters.\nWhat does matter is this: God is love, and our mission is to love, and if we love as we are loved, then we are fulfilling Christ\u2019s commands, and the Law itself, in full.\nNo weapon formed by anyone can overcome the power of love.\nLove is patient. Love is kind.\n\n\nLove keeps no record of wrongs.\n\n\nLove never fails.\nAs we meditate on the hate and violence poured on the innocent recently, let us remember this: Hate cannot drive out hate. Only light can remove the darkness. Only love can cast out all fear.\nLove is our only hope.\nSo, tonight as we gather together with our Muslim neighbors, and come around a table to join hands and unite our hearts as one, my prayer is that we will come to see one another as family. Because this is what will make the Father\u2019s heart smile, and it\u2019s the first step to healing, and peace between us.\nAmen.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

20,Christ Is How We Understand Scripture (Not The Other Way Around),"March 14, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nTry to imagine someone trying to convince you that the menu at the restaurant was better than anything you could eat at that restaurant. Or that the treasure map you were holding was the same as the actual treasure it was pointing you to.\nIf you can imagine that, then you can understand the confusion that many Evangelical Christians have about the Bible. They try to convince you, and possibly even themselves, that the Bible will change your life, and the Bible will bring you comfort, and the Bible will guide your decisions, and the Bible is your absolute authority for everything \u2013 even though the Bible never says anything like that. In fact, not only does the Bible never claim any of these qualities for itself, the Bible DOES claim all of those things for Christ, and the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s where we have a problem.\nSee, once you substitute the Bible for Christ, then you don\u2019t really need Christ, or the Holy Spirit; all you need is the Bible.\nAs I was pondering this the other day, I realized something: Christ is how we understand Scripture, not the other way around.\nThat is: If you actually read the Bible, and follow what it teaches, then you\u2019ll agree that the only way we can understand Scripture \u2013 according to the Bible \u2013 is to know Christ deeply and intimately. Only then can we understand the Scriptures, truly.\nThe Apostle Paul puts it this way:\n\u201cBut their minds were\xa0hardened; for until this very day at the\xa0reading of\xa0the old covenant the same veil\xa0remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ.\xa0But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart;\xa0but whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.\u201d (2 Cor. 3:14-16)\nSee? Whenever we read the Old Covenant scriptures, a veil covers our eyes, and our hearts. What is the only thing that removes this veil? Christ!\n\n\nSo, if we attempt to understand Christ using the Scriptures, we will remain blinded to the reality of Christ. First, we must know Christ \u2013 and this \u201cknowing\u201d is not merely information about Christ, it is an intimate knowledge of a personal Christ who we commune with, listen to, walk with, and relate to in our actual hearts and minds \u2013 and then and only then can we begin to come to understand the Scriptures because it is ONLY in Christ that the veil is removed and we can clearly see the Scriptures.\nOur problem is that we have allowed our pastors and our Bible teachers [and our Seminaries] to convince us that understanding the Scriptures is the same as understanding [or \u201cknowing\u201d] Christ. I\u2019ve actually heard people say that understanding or knowing Doctrine is the same as knowing Christ. This is not only false, it\u2019s actually a very dangerous thing, because it leads people to stop short of actually becoming acquainted with Christ in any real way; once they understand some doctrinal truth, they are told (and believe) that they have come to know Christ \u2013 and this is not the case.\nJesus also warned us against this when he said:\n\n\n\u201cYou search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is\xa0these that testify about Me;\xa0and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.\u201d (John 5:39-40)\nSo, if we search the Scriptures will we find life? Nope.\nBut\u2026we wouldn\u2019t know anything about Christ if we didn\u2019t search the scriptures! Yes, but Jesus says that\u2019s not how we know him.\nWhat must we do? Jesus says we must be willing to come to him so that we may have life. That means, we must enter into an abiding connection with Christ [\u201cabide in me, and I will abide in you\u201d], if we hope to really know Christ as we need to in order to enjoy this life that is only available through him.\n\n\nThe branch doesn\u2019t receive life from the vine by being told that there is a vine, or by learning\xa0 how vines operate. No, the only way a branch receives life from the vine is by being connected to the vine and drawing its own life out of that vine.\nSo, rather than merely study the mechanics of vines and branches, we must actually become connected [like a branch] to the vine [Christ, who is our life], and then we can not only receive true life, we can then also receive what Paul refers to the as the \u201cmind of Christ\u201d \u2013 this is when we are empowered to understand the Scriptures, because that veil is finally removed so we can see clearly.\n\n\nSome people are very confused by all of this, because someone once told them that if truth like this is revealed in the Bible, then the Bible is our authority. Yet, Jesus [in the Bible] says that: \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\u201d (Matt. 28:18)\nSo, let\u2019s try to keep it straight: The Bible never points us to the Bible. The Bible always points us to Christ.\n\u201c\u2026these are the scriptures that testify about [Christ]..\u201d but we must \u201ccome to [Christ] to have life [not the scriptures]\u2026\u201d\nGetting this right is a huge step in our relationship with Christ. Getting it wrong is like eating the menu.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

21,Do You Want To Live A Beautiful Life?,"March 12, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nWendy and I spent most of the day on Saturday at an event that featured author and psychologist Richard Beck. He shared several insights with us that really inspired me to reconsider my approach to the process of Spiritual/Religious Deconstruction.\nAs co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast, I\u2019ve talked to dozens of people \u2013 like Richard Rohr, Bart Ehrman, Derek Webb, Benjamin Corey, Brad Jersak, Bishop Carlton Pearson and David Bentley Hart \u2013 about their process of deconstructing their Christianity and finding new ways to believe in God and how to reject dogma without letting go of Jesus.\n\n\nUsually, the conversations we\u2019ve had about deconstruction involve questioning some Bible verses, re-examining doctrines, and re-thinking what it means to follow Christ.\nFor some, the deconstruction dismantles the entire framework and they are left with nothing to hold onto. For others, they can deconstruct their beliefs that are built on fear and control and come out the other side with a more Christlike view of God that sets them free from empty religion, [and without the desire to be proven right about everything].\nFor still others, the process is still ongoing and they are not quite sure yet just where they are now, or where they might end up when it comes to faith in God or in Christ.\nBut, over the weekend, Richard Beck said something that challenged all of this for me.\nHe was telling us about a conversation he had recently with one of his students who was asking him why God allowed suffering in the world. [BTW: This, if you don\u2019t already know it, is one of the very first threads that most people begin to pull on in their deconstruction journey. Some of the other questions deal with eternal suffering, or the differences between God in the Old and the New Testament, or about why Jesus was tortured by God so that we could be loved and forgiven.]\n\n\nRichard\u2019s response is what really surprised me. Instead of saying, \u201cGo read this book,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s because of freewill,\u201d or any of the usual answers we typically give for the question of suffering, he instead asked the young man this question: \u201cDo you want to live a beautiful life?\u201d\nThe question surprised this student, so at first he didn\u2019t answer, but eventually he said, \u201cSure, I do. Of course.\u201d\nThen Richard said, \u201cHow would you measure that beautiful life? I mean, you\u2019d need to compare your life to something or someone else so you\u2019d know if your life was really beautiful, right? You\u2019d need a standard to measure beauty by, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nThe young man thought about it and nodded. \u201cYeah, that would make sense.\u201d\nSo Richard said, \u201cI want to live a more beautiful life, too. So, for me, my example is Jesus. I think Jesus lived the most beautiful life of all. So, I try to live the way Jesus lived and put his words into practice as a way of living a more beautiful life.\u201d\nIn short, Richard went on to explain to this young man that he would always have these sorts of intellectual puzzles to solve. Trying to answer those philosophical questions can be worthwhile, but they can also distract us from something more essential: living a life that is beautiful; that brings joy and meaning to oneself and others around us.\n\n\nIn other words: What good is it to spend our lives trying to answer these deep philosophical and theological questions if, at the end of our lives, we are still just as empty as when we started?\nIf we take the next 20 years of our life and try to understand the problem of evil, or the nature of God, what will the end result of that be?\nBut, if we take the next 20 years of our lives and try to live like Christ \u2013 loving more, forgiving more, serving more, giving more, humbling ourselves more, becoming more compassionate and self-less \u2013 then what will the end result of that life be?\nHis point, of course, is that it\u2019s more important to live a beautiful life than to become a theologian. On that, I can agree.\n\n\nNow, I do need to point out that this response probably works better for younger people than for older people. Most of those I meet who are deep into their deconstruction process are my age or older. We are the generation that still needs to wrestle with the scriptures, and to re-think those doctrines, and to sort out those theological arguments before we can start to focus on living a more beautiful life.\nHowever, those who are younger than me, on average, are less caught up in what the Bible says about this or that, and are more concerned with what it means to live out their faith in the real world.\n\n\nThat\u2019s why I really loved Richard\u2019s response to this young man. I think it\u2019s a great reminder for all of us \u2013 no matter how old we are \u2013 that some things are more essential than others.\nMaybe it would help some of us who are still wrestling with those theological questions to consider something much more practical to our faith: \u201cDo you want to live a more beautiful life?\u201d\nIf so, then taking Jesus as our example and starting down the road with Christ is how we get there.\nOne day at a time. One kindness at a time. One forgiveness at a time. One enemy loved at a time.\nThe world needs more people who are devoted to living a more beautiful life like this.\nAre you in?\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

22,I Never Go To The Bible For Wisdom: Because The Bible Tells Me Not To,"March 8, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m in a very uncertain place, these days. I moved to a new state. Took a new job. Lost that job. And now I\u2019m trying to figure out why were are here, and what we should do next.\nI have a lot of pretty big, and scary, unanswered questions.\nMaybe you can relate?\n\n\nAre you unsure of what to do with your life? Are your worries about your kids keeping you awake at night? Are you wondering whether or not to make that big career change? Are you trying to decide whether to buy that new house, or to wait for a better time?\nChances are, you are probably in some phase of your life where you\u2019re not sure what to do. In those moments, what should you do? Where should you go for wisdom?\nI would suggest that, if you\u2019re looking for wisdom about these types of questions, the last place you should go is to the Bible.\nIn fact, I have never gone to the Bible for wisdom about what to do about something in my life. Not once.\nDo you want to know something funny? The reason I don\u2019t turn to the Bible for wisdom is because the Bible tells me not to.\nSo, ironically, by not turning to the Bible for wisdom, I am actually following the wisdom of the Bible.\n[Insert sound of gears grinding in Evangelical Christian brains everywhere].",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2019/03/never_go_to_the_bible_for_wisdom/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
23,What I Cannot Live Without,"March 7, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nWendy and I had already pared down our belongings to make the move from Orange, CA to Boise, ID.\nNow, we need to do it again and this time cut everything down to what we can take with us on a flight to China in carry-on and checked baggage. The rest will go into storage for at least the next 2 years.\nI think God is trying to get us to learn how to live more simply.\n\n\n\nSo, as we start to look around our house, the list of things that \u201cspark joy\u201d are photos of our kids, a few books, mementos of our past, a few movies we love, and other than clothes and a few practical things, that\u2019s about all we plan to take with us.\nAmazing how you can live without almost 90% of the stuff you carry around with you when you absolutely need to.\nLess really is more.\nI know that, once we\u2019re in Shanghai, I\u2019ll barely remember or miss any of the other stuff that\u2019s sitting in a box inside a storage unit in California. Our lives are so much more than the things we carry.\nIt makes me think of the quote: \u201cThe things you own end up owning you\u201d.\nI kind of look forward to trimming down my belongings like this. There\u2019s a sense of being set free and travelling light for the next phase of the journey.\nMy friend Steve Hackman sent me a video the other day of his pilgrimage through Europe and he said something about this: about how taking a pilgrimage forces you to take only what is essential for the journey and realizing that the things you need are so much less than you once believed. [Or something like that].\n\n\nSo, Wendy and I are about to embark on a pilgrimage of our own and we\u2019re both excited and terrified. But this is what it means to walk by faith. This is, in fact, what faith is for: To come to the place where your daily prayer is; \u201cOh, God. What\u2019s happening? Where are we going? What do we do now?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a daily devotion to Christ\u2019s leadership in the most everyday, practical sense.\nI realize we could employ the same sort of faith by staying in Boise and depending on God for the finances to pay our bills and provide freelance work or a new job here\u2026.and actually between now and the end of July that is exactly what we\u2019ll be doing\u2026but either way, our path is marked by this same daily dependence upon a God who loves us and who is very good.\nThat\u2019s something I can\u2019t live without.\n**\nHey, if you want to help us make it to Shanghai, you can support us on Patreon.

24,Here and Now: What God Is Doing Today,"March 6, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nAs some of you may already know, I\u2019m going through a bit of a personal crisis at the moment.\nAfter packing everything up, leaving my sons behind in SoCal, saying goodbye to our house church family of 11 years, and relocating to Boise, Idaho for a new job, I\u2019ve found myself unemployed and on the brink of financial disaster.\n\n\nThat\u2019s one way of looking at it.\nHowever, another way of looking at it is this: Wendy and I are doing fine. Today, we have all we need and a bit extra for tomorrow.\nWhat trips us up is when we start to look down the road and wonder \u201cHow will we survive next month?\u201d or ask \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t make enough money to cover our expenses?\u201d\nAs I was driving to an appointment yesterday, I started talking to God in the car. [This is something I do a lot, actually]. So, I just started to tell God about how scary and uncertain the future looked to us, and how we weren\u2019t sure how we were going to survive until August [when we will fly to Shanghai, China to start our next adventure].\nSuddenly, I remembered that God meets us where we are \u2013 not where we are not. Since I am here, now, this is where God meets me: here and now. God provides us with our daily bread. We have what we need for today, and tomorrow we trust that we will have what we need then. But, for now, all we can do is to rest in the promise of today.\nAnd God has met our daily needs. God has provided more than one source of income through various freelance clients, with more possibly on the way. We have money in the bank. Our bills are paid. We have food in the pantry. We are not hurting, or starving.\n\n\nSo, I\u2019m starting to realize how important it is for us to focus on all the good things that God is doing for us right now, and not to spend any time focused on what God might not do for us tomorrow.\nThis has given me a lot of freedom and peace of mind, to be honest.\nNow, it\u2019s not easy. My mind often wanders and my heart is quick to ask \u201cWhat if?\u201d and \u201cHow are we going to make it?\u201d, but I\u2019m learning to shake that off and re-focus myself on the here and now. I ask myself, \u201cWhat do we need for today?\u201d and, if I\u2019m honest, the answer is, \u201cNothing. All my needs for today are met.\u201d\nIf I try to live in tomorrow, I\u2019ll quickly discover that God isn\u2019t there, because I\u2019m not there yet, either. The same holds true for the past. Those things are over and done with. All I have is right here, and right now. This is where I live. This is where God meets me. God is faithful to stand with me, here and now.\nWhat more could I need than this? I guess I\u2019ll find out when the time comes.\nUntil then, I\u2019m going to remain focused on today, and cling tightly to the God who is with me in this very moment.\n\n\n\n\nWhere else should I be than here? When else should I focus than now?\nEach day has enough trouble of its own.\nAm I right?\n*\nHey, if you want to help us make it to Shanghai, you can support us on Patreon.

25,Failing Our Way To Success,"March 4, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nThe Gospel is a picture of what it looks like to descend into greatness. Jesus divested himself of all power, authority and honor to become nothing \u2013 a servant \u2013 and to become obedient even unto death.\nWe\u2019re encouraged to follow Christ in this same path of weakness and humility.\nBut, as one might expect, it\u2019s not a very pleasant process.\n\n\nAs a very relevant and recent example, I am experiencing this failure to success path myself as we speak.\nIn April of 2018, I was let go from a job I had only recently taken on after the company had recruited me away from a job I had held for 10 years. Suddenly, they decided to switch their marketing strategy and my services were no longer required.\nThat\u2019s when I started to pray, and to freelance, and to desperately look for a new job. About six months later, I found one. It was making even more money working as a Creative Copywriting Manager at a company in Boise, Idaho.\nSo, we left our home in Southern California behind \u2013 a place we had lived for 25 years \u2013 and kissed our two college-age sons goodbye, and bid farewell to the house church family we had started 11 years previously \u2013 and headed off to begin our new adventure together in a brand new State.\nWe got here in October, moved into a beautiful house that God provided miraculously, just one mile from my new job. It was perfection.\nMy sights were set on being the best copywriting manager I could be. As I interviewed new copywriters to join our team, I began reading books on team-building and management, I watched YouTube videos about leading teams of creative people, and right before the Christmas break I had finally assembled an amazing team of copywriters that I couldn\u2019t wait to lead into victory.\n\n\nTwo weeks after we got back from the Holiday break, they fired me. It was over before it really had a chance to begin.\nI had assembled this great team of people. I had prepared an entire year\u2019s worth of training and mentoring. I had outlined key areas for improvement internally in our team. And now, it was all over.\nThat was about two months ago.\nWe covered our rent in February thanks to the generosity of friends and supporters of my Patreon page.\nWe covered rent and other bills this month thanks to more generosity and continued Patreon supporters.\nSince being let go, I\u2019ve been back on the freelance and job-hunting track. About two weeks ago I started getting some nibbles. I\u2019ve started doing some freelance. One client signed off on a proposal that should cover us for the rest of this month and cover our rent in April.\nWe\u2019ve got some breathing room now.\nBut, in the meantime, God did something else: He led me to an opportunity that I never saw coming.\nWithout all the crazy details, I\u2019ll just say that I\u2019ve been hired to become a Chaplain/Spiritual Director of Students for a large private International School. In Shanghai, China.\n\n\nYes. Shanghai. China.\nSo, as great as that may sound, the job won\u2019t start until August. That means, until then, my wife and I are still living month-to-month by either the support of our family and friends, or whatever freelance work I can scrape up.\nThis is my life right now.\nOur plan, for now, is to break our lease at this great house in Idaho sometime in May or possibly June. Thankfully, our landlord is a great guy and very understanding.\nIf that works out, Wendy and I will pack up all of our stuff \u2013 once again \u2013 and load it into a Ryder truck, and head back to Orange County, California in a bright yellow blaze of glorious failure and defeat.\nEverything we hoped for, all the expectation we had for this brand new adventure in Idaho, will be officially dead.\nThere\u2019s something in me that really needs to mourn for all the things that could have been, and now never will be.\nYesterday, I took some time to do exactly that. I closed my eyes and imagined all the great things I had hoped were going to come out of this chapter of our lives: Managing and mentoring a team of copywriters; Starting a house church group and watching it grow; Connecting with people here and forming friendships of mutual love and support; Serving the refugee community here along with our friends Nick and Laura Armstrong; Getting to know our neighbors on this street and forming community together, etc.\n\n\nAs I pictured each of these things in my mind, I began to weep. I cried for all of these beautiful experiences we would never get to have now. I wept for the bitterness of failure. I allowed myself to grieve and to experience the profound disappointment that was welling up within me.\n\n\nNow, Wendy and I get to re-box our lives, and re-pack the truck, and drive back home to Orange County with our tail between our legs having failed to accomplish any of those things we had genuinely hoped and dreamed we would.\nNot everything is a loss, of course. We actually did get to start a house church family here with some outstandingly wonderful people. Hopefully, they will continue to gather together after we\u2019re gone. But, we will still mourn the fact that we won\u2019t get to experience this journey alongside them.\nStill, our success looks a whole lot like failure. Honestly, it kind of feels a lot like failure, too.\nOf course, we are very excited about what God might do in Shanghai, China starting in August. We have even higher hopes for that experience since \u2013 unlike our time here \u2013 we\u2019re stepping into a wonderful, supportive community at the school we\u2019ll be serving at and we\u2019ll be fully embraced by our team there who really, genuinely wants us to thrive and succeed in this new endeavor.\n\n\nAs we turn our faces to our life here and now, we are very grateful for all the love and support we\u2019ve received from so many people who have gone out of their way to love us, and bless us, and encourage us, and support us financially during this very painful season.\nWendy and I know that, somehow, God will get us from here to August. Somehow, God will carry us from Idaho, to Orange County, and then on to China and whatever comes after that.\nWe\u2019re learning, daily, how to keep our eyes on God, and to trust that God is good, and that God loves us.\nWe\u2019re also very thankful for all the love of God that has poured out to us from our brothers and sisters in Christ. We know we cannot do this alone.\nSo, here\u2019s to failure, which leads us to success.

26,What If Jesus Isn\u2019t Coming Back Anytime Soon?,"March 2, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nWhat if Jesus isn\u2019t coming back soon?\nFor many Christians, the hope and promise of the imminent return of Christ is just about the only thing that sustains them on a daily basis.\nThey see the world becoming more secular and they experience great discomfort as the culture starts to become less \u201cChristian\u201d and more hostile to their worldview.\n\n\nAs a result, many of these Christians cling to the idea that Jesus will return any moment now to vindicate them, rescue them from this pagan culture and whisk them away to heaven where they will be much more comfortable and will never have to suffer the ungodly world they were born into any longer.\nBut, what if this isn\u2019t going to happen? What then?\nI\u2019m not suggesting that Jesus will NEVER return. But I am suggesting that He might not be coming back in our lifetime.\nAnd if Jesus isn\u2019t coming back soon, then what should we be doing now?\nKeep in mind that for more than 2,000 years, every Christian who believed that Jesus was coming back soon was dead wrong.\nJesus did not return when Christians were being put to death by the Romans. He did not return during the Spanish Inquisition when Christians were tortured for disagreeing with the Catholic Church on their doctrines. Jesus did not return during the Dark Ages, or during the Black Plague. He did not return to stop World War 1. He also did not return when Hitler took power and began to advance an empire that very closely mirrored the Beast and the Anti-Christ we see in Revelation.\nImagine how many Christians must have been convinced that Hitler was the fulfillment of the End Times prophecies they had read about in their Bibles? Or Stalin? Or Idi Amin?\n\n\nBut every single one of them was wrong.\nI\u2019m not trying to get you to doubt the return of Jesus. But I am asking you to consider what you should be doing now \u2013 right now \u2013 with your life and your witness.",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2019/03/what-if-jesus-isnt-coming-back-anytime-soon/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
27,Are We Asking The Wrong Question?,"February 28, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nRecently, while studying the words of Jesus, I made a startling and slightly disturbing discovery.\nOn the issue of salvation, Jesus never seems to urge anyone to say a prayer or confess belief in a set of doctrines. Although he is often asked by those around him, \u201cWhat must I do to inherit Eternal Life?\u201d the answers out of our Savior\u2019s mouth rarely sound anything at all like what I learned in Sunday School.\n\n\nI can remember growing up and hearing the Gospel communicated to me roughly as something like, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to go to Hell?\u201d and when those around me raised their hands to identify themselves as someone with a keen sense of self-preservation, they were told to repeat a prayer about sin and forgiveness.\nNow, as an adult, I am puzzled that Jesus himself never once suggested anything remotely close to this when discussing matters of eternity and salvation.\nTo Zacheus, who declared that he was ready to repay all those he had ripped off through the years, Jesus informed him that his faith had saved him. To the woman at the well, he simply compared himself to a spiritual water which could quench her thirst for fulfillment and she responded enthusiastically. To Nicodemus he explained a concept of being born a second time by the Spirit into a new kind of Spiritual life.\nIn fact, Jesus never seemed to use any sort of formula at all. He never even used the same metaphor twice. His explanations of salvation and his conditions for receiving it were as varied as those who came to ask him the question.\nTo a rich young man Jesus offered salvation if he would obey the Law and the Prophets and then sell all of his possessions and give them to the poor. Another time, he compared the Kingdom of God to a treasure in a field that one must rush gladly to purchase by liquidating every asset and possession to attain. At still another time, Jesus declared a common thief, condemned to death for his crimes, to be justified simply for recognizing who Jesus was and humbly asking to be \u201cremembered\u201d when Jesus entered His Kingdom.\n\n\nHonestly, if you or I, or even our Pastors and Teachers were to respond to a question of salvation in any of these ways, we might be tempted to pull them aside and correct their theology or doctrine. Yet Jesus Himself seemed at odds with our simplistic, Chick-Tract versions of how to inherit eternal life.\nI recently heard Todd Hunter remark that modern American Christianity had reduced the Gospel to a question that never appears in the Bible. You know the one. It goes something like this; \u201cIf you knew for sure that you would die tonight, do you know that you\u2019d be in Heaven tomorrow?\u201d Hunter suggests that, if we\u2019re really going to be true to the Gospel of the Kingdom, and the philosophy of Jesus, we need instead to ask, \u201cIf you knew for sure you\u2019d be alive tomorrow, who would you follow and how would you live your life?\u201d\nAfter all, most of us will not be dead tomorrow. We\u2019ll be alive. What we all need is a Gospel for everyday life. The life we all find ourselves living is precisely where we need Jesus to rule and reign and have His way.\nThe True Gospel involves a daily process of taking up our cross and following Jesus. It is a Gospel for life, not just for the day that we die, and what makes me the most upset is the idea that I\u2019ve wasted so many years of my walk with Jesus focused on the wrong things.\n\n\nTo think I\u2019ve lived most of my Christian life based on the answer to the wrong question. All this time, I\u2019ve thought of Jesus as my \u201cSavior\u201d but not as my \u201cLord\u201d, and yet if He is not one, He cannot be the other.\n\n\nAll this time, I\u2019ve missed the simple truth that Jesus calls me to surrender my life to Him and trade in my own empty kingdom for the Eternal Kingdom of God.\nAll. This. Time.\nEven more horrifying than my own personal realization is the idea that most of modern Christian culture has got it wrong all this time too.\nWe\u2019ve traded a daily submission to Christ for a cheap Grace and a set of beliefs, instead of committing our lives to Jesus and setting Him on the throne of our hearts.\nI have a poster in my office that says, \u201cSometimes well-formed questions are more useful than well-formed answers\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s time for us to start asking the right questions instead of always being so quick with the right answers.\nThe question of where we will spend eternity only prepares us for the day of our death, but gives us no idea of who to follow or how to live our lives until that day should come.\nThe question that Jesus asks us involves making up our minds who we will follow, who will be our Lord, and then committing ourselves to actually obey and live out the Gospel that Jesus died to proclaim.\n\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

28,Dallas Willard: The Lost Interview,"February 27, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nSeveral years ago, I interviewed author and theologian Dallas Willard for a magazine that never made it to print. Instead, I published this interview in a book called \u201cSubversive Interviews\u201d which also included my conversations with author Walter Kirn [Up In The Air, Thumbsucker, etc.], Matt Redman, Jim Wallis [Sojourners], Neil Cole, Frank Viola and many others.\n\n\n\xa0\nHere is part one of that conversation with Dallas Willard:\n\nKeith Giles- \u201cDallas, can you explain the difference between the Gospel of the Kingdom and the more popular, Gospel of the Atonement for us?\u201d\nDallas Willard \u2013 \u201cThe Gospel of the Kingdom is that you can now live in the Kingdom of God and the Gospel of the Atonement is that your sins can be forgiven. Those are the, respective, \u2018Good Newses\u2019, I suppose.\u201d\nKG- \u201cSo, are you saying there are two Gospels? Are my sins not forgiven if I live in the Kingdom? Or am I not in the Kingdom of God if I accept the Gospel of the Atonement?\u201d\nDW- \u201cThe way it practically works out is this, if you have the Gospel of the Atonement, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ve heard, the rest of your life you will run on your own and you may or may not think of being a disciple of Jesus or of obeying him or of devoting your life to the Kingdom of God. You can still do that, but those things are all optional for you. That is where we really stand in our Christian culture today. Anything more than forgiveness of sins, and by that I mean \u2018Heaven when you die\u2019, is optional and most of our professed believers now do not know that they can live in the Kingdom of God now.\n\n\n\u201cBy contrast, anyone who is alive in the Kingdom of God now knows that their sins are forgiven because they have the life of Heaven in them now. So Heaven and forgiveness are natural parts of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God whereas discipleship and holiness and power and other scriptural evidences are not a natural part of the Gospel of the Atonement. I want to emphasize that sense of being a natural part.\n\u201cHere\u2019s one of the ways I try to help ministers understand this difference. I ask them, \u2018Does the Gospel you preach truly lead to discipleship to Jesus?\u2019 and the Gospel of the Kingdom has that natural connection. It\u2019s not trusting the Kingdom, it\u2019s about trusting Jesus and living in the Kingdom with Him. So then, for example, the New Birth is the birth from above and as Jesus was telling Nicodemus, \u201cYou must be born again..\u201d, now that\u2019s about new life that isn\u2019t just Atonement. One of the strange things that has happened is that verses like John 3:16 is treated as if it were a forgiveness verse whereas it is really a new life verse. The whole context is about having the life of The Kingdom. Nicodemus came saying he could see it and Jesus said, \u2018No, you can\u2019t see it\u2019, and helped him to understand why he couldn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s the idea of a natural part of The Kingdom containing forgiveness, and if you\u2019re trusting Jesus, and not just his death on the cross alone, but the person of Jesus, then life in the Kingdom comes with that and, as a natural part, also comes discipleship, forgiveness, all of the things that any good theology would cover.\u201d\nKG- \u201cSo, it seems to me that the reason why the Gospel of the Atonement is the most readily accepted and understood version of the Gospel today, especially in America, is because it\u2019s sort of the fruit of the style of Evangelism we have employed.\nDW- \u201cYes, that\u2019s absolutely right. Now the reason for that, however, is the theology that\u2019s in back of it. We do not evangelize for disciples, we evangelize to make Christians and then, maybe, later try to raise the issue of discipleship. Frankly, that\u2019s like \u2018bait and switch\u2019 in advertising. You\u2019ll hear people express that to their pastors and say, \u2018Why are you talking about discipleship? I\u2019m right with God. Why are you talking about obedience?\u2019 It\u2019s like I talk about in one of the chapters of my book about an upright citizen of the Church who came to his pastor and said \u2018I\u2019m going to divorce my wife because I\u2019ve fallen in love with someone else\u2019 and the pastor, of course, turned purple and said, \u2018You can\u2019t do this\u2019, and the man said, \u2018Of course I can, you\u2019ve said that Jesus will forgive my sins if I believe he died on the cross.\u2019 There\u2019s honestly no response to this from the theology of atonement only.\u201d\n\n\nKG- I was teaching on this recently in our home group and I had a woman, innocently, not trying to be argumentative, but honestly puzzled with me on the subject who asked me, \u2018What would you say to someone if you wanted to evangelize them? If it\u2019s not about going to heaven when you die, then what is it about?\u2019 It just seems that once you diffuse the idea of the Gospel of the Atonement as being an incomplete version of the Gospel, it kind of leaves us unequipped now. So, how do we witness if the language of the Gospel of the Atonement is not part of my script?\nDW- That\u2019s really an excellent question and I hope we can get a very clear answer to it because it naturally comes up because of what people have been taught all their lives. The appropriate question then is, \u2018If you don\u2019t die tonight what are you going to do tomorrow?\u2019 and the answer should be, \u2018I\u2019m going to trust Jesus with all of my life, with everything, and that will allow you to live in the Kingdom of God.\u2019 Now, if you do die tonight you may go to Heaven, but you see most people are not going to die tonight. They, like the rest of us, have to face life tomorrow and the day after and the day after.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe big question is, \u2018Are you going to live life on your own tomorrow and the day after?\u2019 and if you do then you\u2019re not trusting Jesus. The evangelistic question needs to be varied a bit and I use various formulations for it. For example, if it is appropriate I will say to someone, \u2018How are you doing with your Kingdom?\u2019 and that usually opens up the discussion about how they\u2019re handling their lives. I will then let them know that there\u2019s a Kingdom they can live in that belongs to Jesus and that if they will turn their lives over to Him, then they will prosper for time and for eternity, in His Kingdom. That\u2019s the difference.\n\u201cIt opens up a different landscape on evangelism because it turns out that the people that need to hear the Gospel of Jesus the most are the people who are well off and in charge of a lot of things, not just the guy living in the box in the alley, or the person who is living the life of debauchery. All people desperately need to know about the Kingdom of the Heavens and their life in it. So, that\u2019s how you evangelize, you call people to discipleship by announcing the availability of the Kingdom now. That\u2019s what Jesus did and then when people understood him they also understood that He was the King.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe simple Gospel is; \u2018Jesus is available to trust and what you need to do is to trust Jesus\u2019. Once you begin to teach this fully then you begin to realize how great Jesus is and that He is actually running the World and that the Cosmos is under His charge. So then, the invitation is to become involved as a disciple.\n\u201cOne way I try to express what Salvation is is to say \u2018It is participating in the life that Jesus is now living on Earth.\u2019 That is why Paul says, in 1 Corinthians 15, for example, \u2018If Christ is not risen, your faith is in vain and you\u2019re still in your sins\u2019.\nKG- \u201cRight, and also that \u201c..it is not I who lives but Christ who lives in me..\u201d\nDW- \u201cExactly. So, it\u2019s participating in the life that Jesus is now living. Christ in me, the hope of Glory. That was the message to the Gentiles, as reported in Colossians, and that\u2019s the message to everyone. The \u201cHope of Glory\u201d is the living Christ in you and that\u2019s another way of describing life in the Kingdom of God.\n[END OF PART 1]\n\n\n\nTo see the entire conversation, read \u201cSubversive Interviews\u201d by Keith Giles available here>\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

29,"Turn, Turn, Kill?","February 22, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\nThere\u2019s a famous song written by Pete Seeger, yet popularized by The Byrds way back in 1965, called \u201cTurn! Turn! Turn!\u201dYou\u2019ve probably heard it before. It takes the words from Ecclesiastes, chapter 3 and sets them to a groovy tune and says:\xa0\u201cTo everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:\n\n\nA time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, a time to reap that which is planted;\nA time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up\u2026\nA time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.\u201d\nIt\u2019s fascinating to me how often I hear Christians refer to this verse of scripture as a way to justify violence.\xa0\n\u201cIt says in the Bible, \u2018there\u2019s a time for war and a time for peace; a time to kill and a time to heal\u2019, so obviously God makes room for violence when it\u2019s necessary.\u201dBut is that really so?I would argue that there is a time for war and a time for peace, but that Jesus (our Lord) has established for us what \u201ctime\u201d it is now.\xa0Jesus showed up and announced that the Kingdom of God had come. Then he gave us \u2013 his followers \u2013 a very specific command: \u201cLove one another.\u201dNext, Jesus commanded us not to hate our enemies, but to love them.\xa0Then, he rebuked Peter for using a sword by saying, \u201cPut that away! Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword.\u201dThen he told Pilate \u201cMy Kingdom is not of this world. If it were my disciples would fight.\u201dSo while there may very well be a \u201ctime to kill\u201d and a \u201ctime for war\u201d, Jesus has made it very clear that we are now living in a \u201ctime of peace\u201d and \u201ca time to love\u201d.\xa0The question is: Are we following Jesus?One last thought: What if our Judgment Day before the Lord Jesus consists of Him calling our enemies forward to ask them if we loved them as He commanded us to do?What would they say?How would we defend our lack of obedience?The time for love is now. We are in a season of love, not a season of war or hate.\xa0Let\u2019s get busy loving.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

31,A Church That Gives Everything Away,"February 20, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\n\u201cLet the strong take care of the weak; let the weak respect the strong. Let the rich man minister to the poor man; let the poor man give thanks to God that he gave him one through whom his need might be satisfied.\u201d \u2013 Clement of Rome, 1st Century\nEarly in 2004, my wife and I were serving as Children\u2019s Pastors at a local church plant in Orange County, California. Whereas we\u2019d both served on staff at various churches in the past, this was the first time we\u2019d ever been part of an actual church plant that had started off from scratch. The entire process and experience had been exhilarating for both of us. Especially in comparison to the occasions when we had simply filled an existing position at an established church.\n\n\nThe church plant experience had provided us with an opportunity to throw ourselves into the ministries we had come to love, namely teaching children and serving the poor in our community.\nWhenever possible we combined these two ministries. Often we would visit a local senior home and bring the kids in our children\u2019s ministry along with us, as well as our own two elementary-aged boys. We got to see the resident\u2019s faces light up when the kids came in the room, and we got to see the children learning to love people who sit mostly ignored all day long.\nWe also started serving families who were living in a motel a few miles from our church. That\u2019s probably where many of our more radical ideas of church really started to form in our hearts and minds, although it would be another few years before everything would totally come into focus for us.\nI can remember the first time God spoke to me about what He had in mind. I was part of a small team of volunteers from our church who were passing out \u201cEaster Baskets\u201d at the motel. These were laundry baskets filled with supplies and necessities the families needed to care for their children on their limited incomes. We were upstairs and had just run out of baskets. So, while everyone else on the team ran downstairs to get more, I took the opportunity to take a look around me.\n\n\nImagine standing on the second floor of a typical low-rent motel, but all around you there are clues about a reality you\u2019ve never even considered before. I saw children\u2019s shoes piled outside the door of one room; a welcome mat in front of the room next to that one; a set of wind chimes softly blowing in the breeze outside another door; children played tag down the hallway from where I was standing. This wasn\u2019t just a motel. This was home for dozens of families. Already I had been stunned by what I\u2019d seen inside these rooms. There were ten people huddled together in the first room, another ten or so in the second room, and on it went.\nA few years previous to this I had been out of work for almost a year and a half. We had survived by the miraculous grace of God and the exceptional kindness of a few brothers and sisters in Christ. But until this moment I had not known how close we were to the kind of poverty I was seeing in this motel. Families here lived day-to-day on whatever they could scratch together to pay the rent and feed their children.\nI\u2019ll never forget standing on that second floor balcony and hearing God whisper something to me that nearly stopped my heart. He said, \u201cIf you want this place, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d\n\n\nThe kids kept playing in the distance. The sound of muffled conversations echoed from behind closed doors. I stood there for a few moments and considered this offer. Unsure of what He meant exactly, but willing to take the risk all the same, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it, Lord.\u201d And what came next turned our lives upside down in the most amazing way.\nMy first meeting a few weeks later with Pete, the motel\u2019s manager, was less than encouraging. He told me they wanted nothing to do with anything Christian and told me not to waste my time there before inviting me to leave. I was crushed.\nI remember driving home and getting on my knees by our bed and asking God for help. \u201cYou said you would give this motel to me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up this easy, Lord. Either change this manager\u2019s heart, or move him out of the way.\u201d\nOver the next few weeks our small compassion ministries team \u2013 made up of my wife, my myself, and just two other couples \u2013 began to pray together for God to open a door for us at this motel. After a month of praying like this, I tried again.\nThis time the meeting with the manager was radically different. We talked for almost an hour about basketball and what Phil Jackson should do to help the Lakers win another NBA championship. After we solved that problem, Pete, the motel manager, took a breath and asked me, \u201cSo, what exactly were you thinking of doing here?\u201d I explained that we didn\u2019t want to preach to anyone or knock on doors and bother people. \u201cWe just want to help people with their groceries, give their kids a chance to play on a bounce house once a month, and love them the way Jesus told us to,\u201d I said. Pete thought about that a moment and then said, \u201cSounds great to me!\u201d\n\n\nI walked out of that meeting shaking my head in disbelief. We were in! And then God started working on changing my heart.\nMy initial expectations for motel ministry involved starting a bible study in someone\u2019s room and eventually transforming every single person and family in that complex into a vibrant, born again Christian. But God had other ideas.\nI\u2019ll never forget the day. We were cooking hot dogs for the residents in the back parking lot of the motel. The big panda head on the bounce house was bobbing up and down, full of screaming kids. Our small team of volunteers was praying with a few people on the sidelines. Then I heard the Lord\u2019s voice again. This time it was like he put a spotlight on one specific family. The Lord highlighted them for me and said, \u201cJust love them.\u201d\nJust this one family? I wondered. What about all the other people here? But since the message was clear we decided to spend extra time with this one family and to love them as God had instructed.\nMike and Pam had two little kids; Mikee and Shanna. They had been living in the motel for several years now. Although Mike was the father of both children, they had decided not to get married. I later learned it was because to do so would have cut their monthly income down to nothing since Pam received government assistance as an unwed mother and Mike received disability checks for an on-the-job injury. The marriage would erase Pam\u2019s check which they were dependent upon to cover the rent. Mike\u2019s disability covered their food bills.\n\n\nAs I got to know Mike and Pam I also learned more about the conditions of poverty in Orange County, California. I saw first-hand how difficult it was for those who were poor to get ahead. The motel where they lived made them move out every 28 days. This was to avoid having to treat them as legal residents since anyone who lived in a rented room for 30 days or more was legally considered to have renter\u2019s rights and would have to be taxed at a different rate than those whose stay was less than 30 days.\nBecause of this \u201c28 Day Lockout\u201d as it was termed, Mike and Pam had to spend one day every month outside their apartment. If they wanted to keep their things in their room while they were checked out \u2013 and not have to move everything out for a day and then move it back in the day after \u2013 they could pay a $100 storage fee and a $5 key deposit. This sort of nickel-and-dime system is part of what keeps people who are living in poverty trapped there. You can never get ahead or save money because there\u2019s always some new fee or hidden cost.\nOne Sunday we invited Mike and Pam and their kids to church with us. Their kids loved the children\u2019s ministry, and Mike and Pam were very blessed by the morning service. Afterwards we invited them over to our house for lunch. That lunch turned into dinner and a movie too as their kids played with our boys and we sat and talked to Mike and Pam on the couch. But that\u2019s when God started to soften my heart.\n\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the moment. Mikee, their little boy, was playing with Lego\u2019s in my boy\u2019s bedroom. He was a very quiet kid. I don\u2019t think I had ever heard him speak more than three words in a row before this day. Suddenly Mikee stopped playing with the blocks and looked around the room. I realized then that my boy\u2019s bedroom was just about the size of the motel room where his entire family lived. Mikee said to himself, \u201cThis is a house,\u201d with a sense of awe and wonder. Then he went back to playing with the toys on the floor.\nAs the realization of what Mikee was saying began to wash over me, I nearly lost it. This little boy had never been inside a house before. All he had ever known was that little one room motel that he shared with his mom and dad and older sister. I could feel my heart expanding inside my chest.\nSoon after this, God began to speak to my wife and I about stepping out to plant a new church in Orange County. Based on our positive experiences at this new church-plant over the previous three years we were excited about the possibility. But very soon God would challenge our ideas about church and just exactly what sort of church He wanted us to start \u2013 a church that would give away every single cent placed in the offering plate to help the poor in our community.\n\n\nThis radical idea started after we had read a little article by Ray Mayhew called \u201cEmbezzlement: The Corporate Sin of American Christianity.\u201d Essentially, the article unveiled for us the amazing way the early church cared for the poor. Starting with the book of Acts, the article referenced church history to reveal how God\u2019s heart for the poor was an essential ingredient for those who followed Jesus in those first few hundred years.\nIn one section of the article I read about how one first century community of believers responded when a stranger showed up in their village just after they had distributed their weekly allotment of food to the needy. Rather than say, \u201cSorry friend, but we\u2019ve got nothing to share with you right now\u201d \u2013 which frankly is probably what I would have done \u2013 these dear followers of Jesus nearly wrestled one another to the ground to determine which one of them would have the honor of fasting for one week in order to let this stranger eat their food, or sleep in their home.\nAs my wife and I marveled over these testimonies of faith and charity, we started to ask ourselves, \u201cWhat if our new church family shared all their offering with the poor like this?\u201d The more we considered this, the more we knew that the Church that God was calling us to plant should give 100 percent of our offering to help the poor in our community. There was no question in our hearts or minds.\n\n\nOur hearts began to beat faster as we imagined a church like this. I tried to picture the conversations I\u2019d have as I explained to people that our church didn\u2019t spend one penny on salaries or utilities, or anything other than the poor. I couldn\u2019t wait to get started, actually.\nBut then one evening, as Wendy and I were talking and dreaming about this new church I asked, \u201cHow are we going to pull this off?\u201d We both sat there for a second or two, and then Wendy looked at me and said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a house church.\u201d\nI knew she was right. I searched her eyes for a glimmer of doubt or uncertainty, but all I saw reflecting back at me was the same joy I felt in my own heart. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, taking her hand in mine. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d And she was.\nWe both knew then that God was calling us to start a house church, but we didn\u2019t know, yet, how to pay our bills and support our family. Only that I would have to find a job in the workforce and our yet-unformed church family would meet in homes rather than rent or lease a building.\n\n\nWhat followed was a painful process of detaching ourselves from that little church-plant we\u2019d come to love and call home in order to step out into the unknown to launch a church that gave everything away. That little \u201cWhat if?\u201d had started the ball rolling. But I had no idea just how long it would take for me to find full-time employment outside the church. The process was challenging, and it was a full year later before I\u2019d find steady employment. I had no clue at the time that in between our \u201cYes\u201d to God and our first day of house church we\u2019d have to endure so much pain, condemnation, uncertainty, and self-doubt. But now, years later, I can honestly say that it is still the best thing I\u2019ve ever done with the word \u201cChurch\u201d on it.\n\n\nOne of the first things that happened after we announced that we were leaving the church-plant to start a house church was that we lost our house. The owners of the home we were renting called to tell us that they were selling the house and that we needed to move out. How were we supposed to start a house church, I wondered, if we didn\u2019t have a house?\nWeeks went by as we searched for a new house to live in, and soon it was time to move out of our old house. We still hadn\u2019t found a new place to live, and so we ended up moving everything we owned into a storage unit. I was bewildered and confused. \u201cWhat are you doing, God?\u201d But in hindsight it was all part of His plan.\nOur family spent a few weeks sleeping on the floor in the homes of a few friends as we continued to search for a new home. I got up every morning and went to work at a temp job to cover our needs. Those weeks taught us what it was like to be homeless and dependent upon the charity of others and upon our Lord. It was painful, but precious.\nEventually we found the home God had in mind. It was a three bedroom house in a cul-de-sac in Orange with a very large den which was perfect for our new house church family to gather in.\n\n\nOn the day we moved in a little boy from our new neighborhood, Parker, was standing in the driveway when I backed the truck up to the garage door and started to unload. He followed us around the entire day as we unpacked everything, and that evening when we sat around eating pizzas with our small crew of friends who had helped us to move, Parker was still there with us. That was God\u2019s not-so-subtle way of shining a light on the next family He wanted us to love.\nParker\u2019s family, we soon learned, had a lot of problems. The police were often at their house checking on their kids, or responding to a domestic disturbance call. But this family wasn\u2019t the only one with problems, we would come to find out. It turned out that God, in calling us to plant a house church that gave everything away, was also calling us to become missionaries to a specific street in Orange, California.\nOur little house church started small; just my wife and our two boys at first. But slowly, over time, God began to send people our way; people who shared our desire for a church that really did give everything away.\nWe grew little by little. First, five people, then ten people. Single women and families with children found our gathering by word of mouth and the Spirit of God. Eventually we were a few dozen people who were in love with the idea of \u201cbeing the Church\u201d and giving away all that we could to help the poor in our community.\n\n\nThe first year we were together our little church was able to give away almost $5,000 to help people living in poverty in our community. It was so astounding to us that we were able to give so much, and that excitement grew as the next year that number grew by another $2,000, and we expanded the giving to include people within our own church family who lost jobs or met with unexpected financial challenges.\nWhat we learned was that it is very important to care for the poor within our own church family before we go outside the church to help strangers. The other big lesson for us was just how much we could get caught up in the joy of giving and serving others.\nThe funny thing to me is that, even though our little church family was founded on the idea of giving it all away, we never talk much about money or giving when we get together. The basket sits at the back of the room and people drop what they can into it whenever possible, but we never pass it around or emphasize the need to give or share. People seem to have a natural excitement about giving their money when they know that every single penny will go to help people in need, and often to help people they know personally. The joy of giving becomes infectious and viral once people connect their giving with tangible results and changed lives.\n\n\nOur philosophy of giving and sharing comes from Tertullian\u2019s Apology which reflects the attitudes of the earliest Christians regarding offerings:\n\xa0\n\u201cWe are a society with a common religious feeling, unity of discipline, a common bond of hope. We meet in gatherings and congregations to approach God in prayer, massing our forces to surround Him\u2026We meet to read the divine Scriptures\u2026Our presidents are elders of proved character\u2026.Even if there is a treasury of a sort, it is not made up of money paid in initiation fees, as if religion were a matter of contract. Every man once a month brings some modest contribution- or whatever he wishes, and only if he does wish, and if he can; for nobody is compelled; it is a voluntary offering\u2026to feed the poor and to bury them, for boys and girls who lack property and parents, and then for slaves grown old\u2026So we, who are united in mind and soul, have no hesitation about sharing property. All is common among us- except our wives. At that point we dissolve our partnership\u2026Our dinner shows its idea in its name; it is called by the Greek name for love (Agape)\u2026We do not take our places at table until we have first partaken of prayer to God. Only so much is eaten as satisfies hunger. After water for the hands come the lights, and then each, from what he knows of the Holy Scriptures, or from his own heart, is called before the rest to sing to God. Prayer in like manner ends the banquet\u2026\u201d[1]\n\n\n\xa0\nOver the years, our little house church family, which we called \u201cThe Mission\u201d, has been able to make a difference in the lives of several people, and dozens of families.\nSome of what we\u2019ve been able to give has impacted families at the same motel where God first spoke to me about loving people in poverty. Some of those people we\u2019ve served and shared with have been homeless, others have been living on our own street, and still others have been sitting next to us on the sofa every Sunday when we come together to worship and seek the Lord together.\nI wish I had another chapter to tell you all about these amazing opportunities we\u2019ve had to touch people\u2019s hearts and meet their needs as a church family. I wish I could go into detail about how giving away everything we receive has impacted little Parker\u2019s family on our street, and other families who regularly come to our garage for food to make it through another week. I wish I could share with you how our offerings have been able to buy medicine for a woman with cancer, whose husband had just lost his job, and whose insurance stopped covering her prescription. I wish I could tell you all about how we were able to rescue an elderly homeless man with bone cancer and share the tangible love of Jesus with him that final year of his life. I wish I could show you all the wonderful faces of the people we\u2019ve been able to touch by simply sharing what God has given us. I can\u2019t do that here, but what I hope to do is to inspire you, and to challenge you to consider what would happen if you decided to give away everything in the offering plate and keep nothing for yourselves. What could God do in your community if your church did the same thing we did? Imagine the people you would touch, the lives you could transform, the difference you could make by simply deciding to spend the offering on those who need it most. Just imagine.\n\n\nI will say this; for all the lives you would touch and all the difference you might make in taking such a step of faith, no life would have been touched or changed more than your own. That much I can guarantee.\n\n\n\n\xa0\n[1] (Source: Roman Civilization Sourcebook II: The Empire, p.588.)\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

32,Jesus Is Lord (But Not King),"February 15, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\nThe Gospel was once considered a threat to those who held political power.\n\nWhen Paul and the other apostles started preaching about Jesus there were often riots because they were\xa0\u201c\u2026.all defying Caesar\u2019s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.\u201d\xa0[Acts 17:7]\n\n\n\nThere was no doubt about it. This Gospel was dangerous.\n\nJesus was a serious threat to status quo.\n\nCity officials and the crowds were thrown into turmoil over this subversive man. [See Acts. 17:8]\n\nThose who accepted his message were arrested and tortured because of it.\n\nMany went to their death because they refused to hail Caesar as Lord. They were burned alive shouting, \u201cWe have no King but Jesus!\u201d\n\nThe line between following Christ and following the political systems of this world used to be unmistakable.\n\nBut not anymore.\n\nToday, those who claim to follow Jesus may loudly proclaim that \u201cJesus Is Lord!\u201d but they don\u2019t mean that Jesus stands opposed to political powers.\n\nThey may have a \u201cKing Jesus\u201d bumper sticker on their Toyota, but they don\u2019t act as if Jesus is their choice for ruling their world, or their life.\n\nA Christian in the first century knew vividly that their loyalty to Caesar was forfeited now that they had surrendered everything to their new King, Jesus.\n\nEarly Christian teachers spoke often about this shift in loyalty.\nAs Tertullian wrote to the Romans around the year 195:\n\n\n\u201cIn us, all zeal in the pursuit of glory and honor is dead. So we have no pressing inducement to take part in your public meetings,\xa0nor is there anything more entirely foreign to us than the affairs of State.\u201d\nOrigen also wrote to Celsus in an attempt to explain the peculiar Christian practice of noninvolvement with Roman politics, saying:\n\u201cIt is not for the purpose of escaping public duties that Christians decline public offices, but that they may reserve themselves for a diviner and more necessary service in the Church of God\xa0\u2013 for the salvation of men. And this service is at once necessary and right.\u201d\nHe also explains to Celsus that those who follow Christ recognize another, higher authority than the State and that because of this they urge their brightest and best to apply their wisdom and talents and qualities of leadership to further the more urgent and necessary work of the Kingdom of God:\n\u201cWe recognize in each state the existence of another national organization [the Church], founded by the Word of God, and we exhort those who are mighty in word and of blameless life to rule over Churches.\xa0Those who are ambitious of ruling we reject; but we constrain those who, through excess of modesty, are not easily induced to take a public charge in the Church of God.\xa0And those who rule over us well are under the constraining influence of the great King, whom we believe to be the Son of God, God the Word. And if those who govern in the Church, and are called rulers of the divine nation \u2014 that is, the Church \u2014 rule well, they rule in accordance with the divine commands, and never suffer themselves to be led astray by worldly policy.\u201d\n\n\nTo Origen, and Tertullian, and every other Christian in those first 300 years of the Untangled Church, the issue was clear and the differences were distinct:\xa0Those who were citizens of the Kingdom of God were uninterested in the politics of men.\nWhy? Because they already had a King. His name was Jesus. They had already pledged their loyalty to another nation. It was called the Kingdom of God.\n\n\nTry to imagine if Jesus were the King of your life in the same way that He was King over the lives of those early Christians who defied Caesar to the point of death and who pledged allegiance to\xa0\u201canother King, one called Jesus.\u201d\n\nWhat would that look like? How would it change the way you live today?\n\nI wonder, if those early Christians could see the Church in America today, what would they conclude?\n\nWould they assume that, to us, Jesus is really only \u201cKing\u201d in a metaphorical sense?\n\nOr would they see a Church that was under the absolute authority of Christ?\n\nWould they see Christians who loved their enemies, welcomed the stranger, cared for the hungry, showed compassion to the prisoner, and forgave those who spoke against them?",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2019/02/jesus-is-lord-but-not-king/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
33,Unbalanced: The Dangers of Unconditional Love,"February 14, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nAnytime we speak about the extravagant and unending love of God for people, we must always remind ourselves \u2013 and one another \u2013 just how sinful and undeserving we are of such amazing love.\nThe danger, of course, is that we might fixate too much on God\u2019s audacious love and not spend enough time meditating on our own worthlessness.\n\n\nSeveral authors are guilty of this. For example, people like Philip Yancey, and Brennan Manning tend to go on and on about God\u2019s great love for us, and even seem to emphasize our full acceptance of this love, without balancing these ideas with the truth [which is that we are slimy worms who could never deserve such unmerited grace and love].\nFor example, here\u2019s what Yancey says about God\u2019s grace:\n\u201cGod loves people because of who God is, not because of who we are.\u201d\xa0\n\u201cI would far rather convey grace than explain it.\u201d\xa0\nNotice how he makes no mention of our sins? Hmm\u2026\nNow, look at what Manning says:\n\u201cGod loves you exactly as you are, not as you should be, because none of us will ever be as we should be.\u201d\nOk, he does mention our sins but he fails to emphasize how our sinfulness is repulsive to God and how our failures can be a barrier to God\u2019s great love.\nAs bad as these may be, the worst offender of all is this guy Paul, the Apostle.\n\n\nNotice what he says about God\u2019s great love:\n\u201cI pray that you, being rooted\xa0and established in love,\xa0may have power\u2026to grasp how wide and long and high and deep\xa0is the love of Christ,\xa0and to know this love that surpasses knowledge\u2014that you may be filled\xa0to the measure of all the fullness of God.\u201d [Eph. 3:17-19]\nWorse yet, Paul doesn\u2019t follow up this thought about God\u2019s awesome love with any verses about how much we don\u2019t deserve that love. Shameful.\nAnd it gets worse:\n\u201cWho shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?\u2026No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d [Romans 8:35-39]\nHere, Paul not only goes on and on about God\u2019s miraculous and astounding love for us, he even tries to convince us that nothing can separate us from this great love. Really, Paul? Not even our slimy, undeserving sinfulness?\n\n\nIn another epistle, Paul drops casual references to God\u2019s love for us and uses it as motivation for how we should love one another:\n\u201cTherefore, as God\u2019s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.\u201d [Col. 3:12]\nOf course, Paul even went so far as to write an entire chapter about love [see 1 Cor. 13] without ever mentioning how much none of us deserves God\u2019s great love. Talk about a missed opportunity.\nThe other Apostles are no better. John, for example, who has the gall to call himself \u201cthe one the Lord loved\u201d also talks about God\u2019s love for us without the necessary caveats:\n\u201cGod is love, and all who live in love live in God, and God lives in them.\u201d [1 John 4:16]\n\u201cSee what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! [1 John 3:1]\nAgain, all references to how much we don\u2019t deserve God\u2019s great love are \u201cconveniently\u201d omitted.\n\n\nThe dangerous thing here is that Christians who read this might actually start to forget their filthy sinfulness and begin to focus only on the goodness, and kindness, and graciousness of a God who loves them so much that He would rather die than live without them.\nJust imagine what would happen if more and more Christians started to forget what horrible people they are? Sure, they might start to experience more joy in their lives, but they might also start to forget what shame and guilt feel like.\nAnd then what?\nThe more Christians start to become aware of God\u2019s unmerited favor and His love that surpasses knowledge, the more they might also start telling others about it, too.\nDo we really want to live in a world where the emphasis is on God\u2019s continual, unending love for those who are made in His image? Are we prepared for the consequences of this unbalanced approach to the Gospel, or to life itself?\nThe implications are almost unbelievable.\nAlmost.\n\n\n**\n\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

34,Jesus: The Goat Shepherd,"February 12, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\nI\u2019m currently reading a book about the early Christian church and came across this amazing section about the Christian Catacombs:\n\u201cIt is well known that from the end of the First to the end of the Fourth Century, the early Christians buried their dead\u2026in subterranean galleries excavated in the soft rock that underlies Rome. These ancient cemeteries were first uncovered in 1578\u2026more than six, some estimates say eight million bodies are known to have been buried between AD 72 and AD 410\u2026the emblems and inscriptions are most suggestive. The principal device [image], scratched on slabs, carved on utensils and rings, and seen almost everywhere is the Good Shepherd\u2026but most striking of all, he is found with a goat on his shoulder; which teaches us that even the wicked were at that early date regarded as objects of the Savior\u2019s solicitude, after departing from this life.\u201d [\u201cUniversalism: The Prevailing Doctrine of the Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years\u201d, J.W. Hanson, Pub. 1899; pg. 28-29]\n\n\n[Image: Jesus as the Good Shepherd from the Catacombs]\n\nNot only is this an awesome realization in itself, but what is also fascinating is what is missing from these catacombs: A cross.\nAs the author continues:\n\u201cEverywhere in the Catacombs is the anchor, emblem of the hope which separated Christianity from Paganism. Another symbol is the fish [ICHTHUS], which plays a prominent part in Christian symbolry\u2026these and the vine, the sheep, the dove, the ark, the palm and other emblems in the Catacombs express only hope, faith and cheerful confidence.\u201d [pg. 29]\nFurthermore, the inscriptions found in the Catacombs are most remarkable for what they don\u2019t say. Each epitaph is full of hope and joy; nothing about suffering or pain or gloom:\n\u201c\u2026not a word is found expressive of doubt or fear, horror or gloom, such as in subsequent generations formed the staple of the literature of death and the grave, and rendered the Christian graveyard, up to the beginning of the seventeenth century, a horrible place. The first Christians regarded the grave as the doorway into a better world, and expressed only hope and trust in their emblems and inscriptions.\u201d [pg. 30-31]\n\n\nAnother scholar, John Ruskin, notes: \u201cNot a cross as a symbol in the Catacombs. The earliest Latin cross is on the tomb of the Empress Galla Placidia, 451 AD. No picture of the crucifixion until the Ninth Century, nor any portable crucifix until long after. To the early Christians Christ was living, the one agonized hour was lost in the thought of his glory and triumph. The fall of theology and Christian thought dates from the error of dwelling upon his death instead of his life.\u201d [pg. 33]\nF.W. Farrar adds: \u201cWe find in the Catacombs neither the cross of the fifth and sixth centuries, nor the crucifixes of the twelfth, nor the torches and martyrdoms of the seventeenth, nor the skeletons of the fifteenth, nor the cypresses and death\u2019s heads of the eighteenth. Instead of these, [we see] the symbols of beauty, hope and peace.\u201d [pg. 34]\nSo, taking all of this in, it seems that those early Christians saw Jesus as a Good Shepherd who carried home even the goats into his fold, and they referenced images of the anchor, the palm, the dove, the fish, the vine and the ark in their art, but not the symbol of the cross.\nTheir emphasis \u2013 in life and in death \u2013 was the victory of Christ over death, and the joy and hope and life that was to be found in Christ.\n\n\n\n\nSadly, Christians slowly began to lose this great hope and joy over time and eventually traded these joyous symbols for crosses and lamentations about suffering, pain and anguish regarding both life and death.\nI\u2019m personally inspired to embrace these hopeful images of Christ as Good Shepherd who cradles the goats in his arms.\nI love the idea of emphasizing the great hope we have in Christ rather than glorify suffering and pain.\nWe have a lot to learn from those early Christians, I think.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

35,Is Christ Really In All Of Us?,"February 8, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\u201cIf something goes wrong, I\u2019m the first to admit it. The first to admit it, and the last one to know.\u201d",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2019/02/is-christ-in-all-of-us/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
36,Barna Poll: Millennial Christians Have More Non-Christian Friends,"February 6, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nBarna Research released new survey results this week that they \u2013 and many other Evangelical Christians \u2013 are casting in a negative light. However, they\u2019re emphasizing one set of results over against another set which is much more positive.\nThe report, entitled \u201cAlmost Half of Practicing Christian Millennials Say Evangelism Is Wrong\u201c, leads off with the shocking news that Millennial Christians are largely uninterested in sharing their faith with their non-believing friends. [More on this in just a moment].\n\n\nWhat the survey also reveals is that these Millennials are MORE equipped than other age groups to actually share their faith with others. Here\u2019s the quote from the survey:\n\u201cAlmost all practicing Christians believe that part of their faith means being a witness about Jesus (ranging from 95% to 97% among all generational groups), and that the best thing that could ever happen to someone is for them to know Jesus (94% to 97%). Millennials in particular feel equipped to share their faith with others. For instance, almost three-quarters say they know how to respond when someone raises questions about faith (73%), and that they are gifted at sharing their faith with other people (73%). This is higher than any other generational group: Gen X (66%), Boomers (59%) and Elders (56%).\u201d\nSo, it\u2019s not that Millennials don\u2019t know what to say if someone asks them about their faith in Christ. It\u2019s also not that they feel like they aren\u2019t capable of doing so successfully. If anything, Millennials are more confident in the reasons why they have faith in Christ than other age groups, and they are more at ease with the idea of having those conversations if they ever come up.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem here? Well, I think the \u201cproblem\u201d, as Evangelical Fundamentalist Christians see it, is mostly that they are terrified that this demographic isn\u2019t very interested in perpetuating the Christian faith. They\u2019re afraid that they may one day have to live in a world where Christianity isn\u2019t the majority, or that other faiths might gain popularity and eclipse the Christian worldview.\nIn other words, Evangelicals are freaking out that Millennials aren\u2019t out there selling Christianity to their friends. What they don\u2019t understand is that it has more to do with the question Barna asked them in this survey, and less to do with any actual desire to share Christ with others.\nThe question is about evangelism. That word conjures up arguments around the dinner table about who is right and who is wrong. It evokes bad memories of \u201cUs vs Them\u201d confrontations that usually end in tears and someone being told they will burn in hell for their unbelief.\nThis is what Millennials are not interested in doing.\nHere\u2019s another interesting finding of this same survey that is not getting the attention it deserves:\n\n\n\u201cAmong practicing Christians, Millennials report an average (median) of four close friends or family members who practice a faith other than Christianity; most of their Boomer parents and grandparents, by comparison, have just one.\u201d\nDo you see this? Millennial Christians have four times as many non-Christian friends in their life than Boomers or Gen X Christians. Yet, it is those other groups that are more gung-ho about evangelism to non-Christians.\nHow is it that those groups that are most pro-Evangelism have almost zero connections with non-believers? How is it that the group that is less interested in Evangelism has more interaction and actual relationships with people who are unlike them and practice other faiths, or have no faith at all?\nHere\u2019s what the survey is missing completely: Millennial Christians are much more open to loving people who are not inside their circle of faith. They are in daily, constant relationships with non-believers. This is what it means to be \u201csalt and light\u201d, my friends.\n\n\nThis is very good news for the future of Christianity, in my opinion. I am very excited to learn that this next generation of Christ-followers is more interested in listening to people who think differently and less interested in having arguments about who is right or wrong.\n\n\nLove is their mission. Actual relationships are their goal. Friendships with people of other faiths, or even with no faith whatsoever, are more important to them than being right.\nIf anything, I hope and pray that we could listen to these Millennial Christians and learn from them. This is the future of true Christian practice. If older generations refuse to take note, they will fade into the background and vanish in a puff of smoke. [Actually, they will do so no matter what. But the future is not found by convincing the next generation to be more like us. The future is found in listening to the wisdom of the next generation and empowering them to be who they already are].\nIf we can learn anything from this Barna survey it\u2019s this: The future of Christianity looks much more loving and Christlike than in any previous generation.\nThat\u2019s cause for celebration, don\u2019t you think?\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

37,How Agreement Divides Us,"February 6, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nOk, I know this seems counter intuitive, but stay with me here. Whenever we form groups or define ourselves by what we believe, or what doctrines we agree about, we\u2019re actually defining everyone who doesn\u2019t agree with us as \u201cthem\u201d or marking them as outsiders.\nI\u2019ve seen this happen too many times. Especially in house church circles. [Not that this doesn\u2019t also happen in every other form of church that\u2019s out there, but my concern is mostly with those who attempt to gather in the New Testament model of ekklesia].\n\n\nWe tend to form friendships and create bonds with people who are just like us. That\u2019s natural. Most of us form close friendships with people precisely because we discover a common bond of agreement on certain issues, or due to an shared affinity for art, music, sports, literature, etc.\nThis is common. But the Body of Christ is called to be uncommon. Our gatherings are meant to reflect Christ, and if everyone in the group is a carbon copy of everyone else, where is the variety, or the inclusiveness of the Kingdom that is intended to be made up of people from every tongue and tribe and nation?\nMost house churches face two very real dangers: One is the danger of disagreement \u2013 where arguments are common and meetings feel like endless theological debates, and the other is the danger of agreement \u2013 where everyone high-fives one another and nods their heads at every theological statement because no one is allowed if they don\u2019t already agree with everyone else.\nThere is another way: We learn to focus our meetings on Christ alone and not on agreement, or on disagreements, with any one specific theology or doctrine.\nSound far-fetched? Well, my wife and our family and dozens of others did exactly that for over 11 years. Our house church was filled with people who did not agree on almost anything other than our love for Christ and our desire to know and follow Christ in our daily lives. We also agreed on our devotion to one another and to relating to one another as members of God\u2019s family.\n\n\nBut, we did not spend any time debating theology or arguing for agreement on doctrines. It was glorious!\nNow that we are starting a new house church here in our new home town of Meridian, Idaho, we face another challenge: The challenge of agreement.\nIn this new community, many of us share very similar ideas about theology and embrace many similar ideas about God. But this is a challenge because the temptation is to make our agreement on these things the center of our gatherings, rather than simply Christ.\nThe tricky part is to share what we know of Christ in a way that honors the other person and allows them to hold slightly different ideas without feeling they are on the outside of the group, or less spiritual or discerning than the rest of the Body.\nFor example, when we share our personal convictions we can do so with grace and leave room for others to have other ideas. In humility, we can express our deepest heart and still admit the possibility that we just might be wrong about a few things.\nBeing right or being wrong should never be our ultimate goal. Honesty, is good. Love is better. Grace is essential. Humility is celebrated.\nIf we can do this, if we can come together admitting that we need Christ, and that we are longing to know Christ more intimately, and to embody Christ more deeply, and to experience Christ in an authentic way, then leaving all that other garbage at the door is a lot easier.\n\n\n\n\nOnce we become aware of Christ\u2019s presence in our midst, and surrender to Christ\u2019s leadership, everything else becomes \u201cstrangely dim\u201d and we realize that all of our ideas are foolishly inadequate anyway.\nAll throughout Church history, every time we have sought to bring unity by crafting a doctrine or a statement of faith, we have instead always created more division.\nAgreement does not create unity. Agreement creates division.\nAccording to the New Testament, only one thing makes us one and that is Christ Jesus.\n\u201cFor we are all one in Christ,\u201d Paul says in Galatians 3:28.\nIf we can lay aside our desire to identify as Christians who are defined by our doctrines, then \u2013 and only then \u2013 is it possible for us to see one another as simply Children of God who are all in Christ, the one in whom we all live and move and have our being. [See Acts 17:28]\nCan we do this? I know we can. I did it for 11 years in Orange, CA. I intend to do so again in Idaho.\nUnity is found only in Christ. Let\u2019s find one another in Christ and fulfill our calling to be one with one another even as Christ and the Father are one.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

38,A Better Way To End Abortion In America,"January 31, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nChristians in America are stuck on a problem they can\u2019t seem to solve.\nIt\u2019s a problem that unites nearly all of us together. In fact, other than Jesus himself, no other topic or issue so completely unites Christians than this. I\u2019m talking about abortion, of course.\nBut we\u2019ve been stuck on how to solve this problem since 1973.\n\nSeriously.\n\n\n\nHas anyone ever told you the definition of insanity? It\u2019s doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result.\nFor over 40 years now Christians in America have been trying to stop abortions in this country doing the same thing, over and over again, and expecting a different result.\nThat\u2019s insane.\nMy wife teaches 7th\xa0grade Math. Whenever a student gets stuck on a problem, they usually raise their hand and ask for help.\nI think we need to do that now.\nWhy? Because after two terms of Reagan, two terms of George W.Bush, and a Republican-majority congress at various times over the last 40 years, virtually zero progress has been made.\n[Read more about that HERE]\nThe evidence is clear: A political solution to abortion isn\u2019t working.\nBut most Christians are totally unaware that there was already a Pro-Life Movement that actually DID significantly reduce the abortion rate in America, and they did it without politics.\n\n\nBack in the 1800\u2019s abortion was so rampant that ads ran in the newspapers for them. The abortion rate, adjusted per capita for increased population, was higher than what we experienced after the Roe vs Wade decision.\nIn the book, \u201cAbortion in America\u201d this time between 1840 and 1880 is referred to as \u201cThe Great Upsurge of Abortion,\u201d and estimates are that at least 20 percent of pregnancies were ending in induced abortion during that time in history.Another book, \u201cThe Great Crime of the Nineteenth Century,\u201d by Edmund Hale, claimed two-thirds of pregnancies during the mid-to-late 1800\u2019s ended in induced abortions.\nIt was a dark time.\nAs you might expect, the Christian church of the day was determined to end abortion, or at least to slow it down.\nBy 1910 they successfully cut the national abortion rate in half.\nHow did they do it?\nSimply put, Christians created a movement where pregnant women were provided with positive alternatives to abortion.\n\n\nThey focused on helping young women in poor communities, including prostitutes, who found themselves in trouble.\nThey came alongside these women and encouraged them to carry their children full-term. Then they helped them to find adoptive parents for their unborn child.\nOr, they simply stood by these women and committed themselves to providing childcare to help them finish school, or find work so they could keep their child.\nBy putting the Gospel into practice, these followers of Jesus transformed their society from within \u2013 one person at a time.\nIt was led by Christians. It was accomplished by loving our neighbor as Jesus commanded. It did not rely on the passage of laws or elected officials.\nIf our passion is to end abortion in our nation, the best way to do this is to circumvent political processes which, to date, have proven ineffective, and devote ourselves to loving our neighbor as Jesus commanded.\nAs long as we continue to put our hope in politicians we will never end abortion in this nation. To continue to seek out a political solution is the very definition of insanity.\n\n\nBut, If we commit ourselves to sharing the love of Christ with those around us, we might just discover that Jesus was right all along about how to change our world for the better.\n\n\n-kg\nPS: Believe it or not, the\xa0abortion rates\xa0in the United States are\xa0steadily declining\xa0according to a\xa0number of sources.\nAnd, Roe vs Wade will probably never be overturned by the Supreme Court due to a long list of Constitutional and Common Law grounds. But if we are successful in transforming the hearts of people around us, it won\u2019t matter what laws are on the books.\n*This post is excerpted from my book \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201c\n\xa0\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

39,Let\u2019s Imagine Christianity Without Politics,"January 30, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nA few days ago I received an email from a friend of mine. He was sharing with me his frustration over the apparent blindness that many Christians seem to have when it comes to following Jesus.\nHis experience was that every time he attempted to talk about doing what Jesus commanded us to do \u2013 like loving our enemies, turning the other cheek, caring for the poor, etc. \u2013 the responses he kept receiving were comments like, \u201cBut the Founding Fathers say\u2026\u201d, or \u201cThe Constitution says..\u201d, or \u201cCommon sense tells you\u2026\u201d,\xa0 and so on.\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t something new to me. I\u2019ve had \u2013 and continue to have \u2013 similar conversations with Christians on almost a daily basis.\nSo, what\u2019s going on here? Why is this such an ongoing problem in the American Church today? What can we do about it?\nI have a few ideas.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\nMost Christians simply do not understand the Gospel, plain and simple. I know this because \u2013 only about 10 years ago \u2013 I was also unaware of what the actual Gospel was all about. Keep in mind, I was also a licensed and ordained Southern Baptist pastor at that time.\nSee, I used to believe that the Gospel was about saying a prayer so that I could go to heaven when I die.\nBut that\u2019s not the Gospel.\nThe Gospel \u2013 or the \u201cGood News\u201d \u2013 that Jesus came and died to proclaim is found (curiously enough) in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.\nHere\u2019s what the \u201cGood News\u201d (or the Gospel) is according to the NT:\n\n\n\u201cJesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom..\u201d (Mat. 4:23)\n\u201cJesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. \u201cThe time has come,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!\u201d (Mar. 1:14-15)\n\u201cBut he said, \u201cI must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.\u201d (Luk. 4:43)\nWait a minute, what does this have to do with why Christians confuse America with the Kingdom of God?\nGood question!\nSee, because Christians have confused the Gospel with saying a prayer so you can go to heaven, they\u2019ve neglected to see the Gospel as something that is for here and now. That has led us to a Christianity that is largely about something that only starts to kick in once we\u2019re dead \u2013 rather than a Gospel that\u2019s about a way of life that starts once you decide to follow Jesus.\nIt\u2019s also a problem because Christians today largely do not see their faith as something to be lived out. Instead, they see their faith as something that needs to be believed.\n\n\nOnce you reduce the Gospel as something that only needs to be believed \u2013 and not obeyed \u2013 then you can simply read the words of Jesus and say, \u201cI believe that!\u201d and think that you\u2019ve done all that Jesus asks of you.\nOf course, if we think a little longer about that we\u2019ll see that this makes no sense \u2013 and that it\u2019s not at all what Jesus says.\nIf your parents told you to clean your room and your response was, \u201cI believe that!\u201d, do you think you\u2019d be an obedient child?\nObviously, Jesus gave very specific commands to his disciples (that\u2019s what the NT calls \u201cChristians\u201d) and his constant refrain was that those who love Him obey Him, and those who do not love Him do not obey. (See John 14: 15-24)\nWhat we have today in America is a Christian Church that is filled with people who have \u201cprayed the prayer\u201d and \u201cbelieve the Gospel\u201d but they do not see the words of Jesus as being for them today, nor do they understand that the Gospel is about submitting to the Kingship of Jesus in their actual, daily life.\n\n\nHow do I know this? Because on almost a daily basis I encounter Christians who respond to the clear commands of Jesus with a long list of \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d statements.\nAnother serious problem we have is that Christians in America have confused their faith with American Christianity. In other words, to be a good Christians means being a good American. More specifically, in my experience at least, being a good Christian means being a conservative Republican.\nIn essence, many Christians in America can\u2019t untangle Jesus from their politics.\nI sometimes try to help those people think differently by saying: \u201cImagine that someone in North Korea or Communist China hears the Gospel and repents and begins to genuinely follow Jesus. Are they now also a Republican?\u201d\nSee, the fact is that most of the Christians on this planet are not American, or Republican. In fact, most of them aren\u2019t even Capitalists.\nI would take this even further by suggesting that no Christian should ever identify as a Capitalist, or a Socialist, or as a Republican or a Democrat, or as an American or any other nationality.\n\n\nAccording to the Gospel, everyone in Christ is now a new creation. The old has gone and the new is now here. That means, in the Church, there is now no longer any Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male nor female, etc. but we are all one in Christ Jesus. [It\u2019s in the NT, trust me].\nJesus is our life. Jesus is our king. His Kingdom is now our home. We pledge allegiance to no one else \u2013 and to no other nation \u2013 except for Jesus and His Kingdom.\nThis nation \u2013 the United States of America \u2013 will soon pass away. In fact, it MUST pass away in order for the eternal Kingdom of Jesus to be fully established here on earth \u2013 so must every other nation and government, and every political ideology and man-made philosophy. [And why would we want to put our energies into propping up a nation or a political system that is destined for the ash can when we could be working towards advancing the Kingdom of God?]\nIf we really believe these things, then it\u2019s time to start living all of that out.\nJesus is Lord. He is Lord right now. He is my Lord. His commands are binding on me because I am already a citizen of His eternal Kingdom. It doesn\u2019t matter what the Constitution says. It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else thinks. Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega. Everyone else is only a pretender to the throne.\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s swear allegiance to Jesus and commit ourselves to Him and His Kingdom and begin to put His words into practice starting today.\nOr, as Jesus phrased it: \u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord, lord\u2019 and do not do what I say?\u201d \u2013 Jesus\n-kg\n\n\nIf you want to read more about this topic, I cover it in my book \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance to The Lamb\u201c, available now on Kindle, Audiobook and Print.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

40,The Shiny Red Button (How Republicans Use Abortion To Manipulate Christians),"January 28, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\n*NOTE: I share this guest post from my friend Eric Johnson as a former Republican who has since abandoned all faith in politics and politicians. Both Democrats and Republicans use these same tactics to manipulate their base. This is not an attack on Republicans. It\u2019s a wake up call for American Christians to abandon politics and pledge allegiance to the Lamb.\n\n\n*\nLet\u2019s look at the role of Republicans in the History of abortion, shall we?\nPlanned Parenthood started receiving funding in 1970 when Republican POTUS Richard M. Nixon signed into law the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act, which had the support of both Democrats and Republicans.\nIn 1973 was the landmark case Roe v. Wade. There were 9 Supreme Court justices who ruled on that case: 5 Democrats and 4 Republicans.\nIt was passed by a 7-2 ruling.\nBoth a Republican and a Democrat opposed.\nThat means 3 out of 4 justices voted in favor of Roe. vs Wade.\nIn 1992 there was the Supreme Court case of Planned Parenthood vs. Casey.\nOut of 9 justices there was only one Democrat on the bench. They had an opportunity to over turn R v. W, but they didn\u2019t.\nInstead they ruled reinforcing abortion being protected by the 14th Amendment.\nIn the 46 years since Roe vs. Wade Republicans have had control of the Senate:\n\u2013 1981 to 1987\n\u2013 1995 to 2001\n\u2013 2003 to 2007\n\u2013 2015 to 2019\nSo far that\u2019s a total of 20 years out of the 46 since R v. W became law.\n\n\nLikewise in the 46 years since Roe v. Wade became law Republicans have controlled the House:\n\u2013 1995 to 2007\n\u2013 2011 to 2019\nAgain, out of 46 years since Roe v. Wade was decided Republicans have controlled the House for 20 of those years.\nFrom 1995 to 2007 Republicans controlled both the House and Senate.\nFrom 2001 until 2007, and then again 2017 to 2019 Republicans controlled the House, Senate and the Presidency.\nAlso from 2001 to 2007 on the Supreme Court nine out of the 11 justices who served during that time were Republican.\nIn other words: The greatest chance for Republicans to end legalized abortion was between 2001 and 2007 when they controlled the House, the Senate, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court.\nNot once did they de-fund Planned Parenthood, pass legislation to outlaw abortion, or overturn Roe v. Wade.\nThey could have, but didn\u2019t.\nThey had ample opportunity.\nFrom 2017 until the present Republicans have once again controlled the House, Senate, Presidency, and SCOTUS.\nAsk yourself this: After 46 years\u2026\nWhy is abortion still legal?\nWhy is Planned Parenthood still funded?\nWhy hasn\u2019t Roe vs. Wade been overturned yet?\n\n\nPeople are quick to blame Democrats for abortion in the U.S. while turning a blind eye to the MASSIVE amount of blood on Republicans hands.\nThey are quick to demonize those of the opposing political party while giving their own party a free pass when they share in responsibility.\nSo, with all of this laid out here I\u2019m going to share with you a cold, hard fact that maybe hard for most to swallow:\n\n\nIf you have voted Republican anytime since 1970 the odds are you have voted for someone who has voted in favor of a bill that funded Planned Parenthood.\xa0#Truth\n-Thanks to my friend Eric Johnson\nIf you want to read more about this topic, I cover it in my book \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance to The Lamb\u201c, available now on Kindle, Audiobook and Print.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

41,Learning From The Wrong People,"January 25, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nProfessor Lee Ross has done a lot of work in conflict resolution, promoting dialog between various groups in places like Northern Ireland and in the Middle East where he worked with both Palestinians and Israelis.\nHere\u2019s what he noticed about those who stand on either side of an argument:\n\n\n\u201cPeople on both sides are always interested in meeting with those from the other side,\u201d he says. \u201cBut why do they want to meet? Because they want to explain to the other side how things really are, and they think that if they do that the other person will become easier to deal with in the future. If that doesn\u2019t work then it just proves that those on the other side aren\u2019t objective or reasonable. What I have never experienced in 40 years of doing this is people who say \u201cI really want to meet with the other side because I think I have things wrong\u201d or \u201cI think I\u2019m biased and I want to meet with the other side so they can set me straight.\u201d I\u2019ve never, ever had the experience of even a single individual tell me that.\u201d\nNotice that he says that he has never experienced people from the other side wanting to talk to those they disagree with so they can see where they themselves might be off?\nThat\u2019s the problem. No one is willing to admit the possibility that they are wrong about something. No one is willing to confess that they are capable of having anything new to learn from the other side.\n\n\nIt\u2019s no different in our churches. As long as we refuse to admit that we have something to learn, we will never learn anything, and we\u2019ll never be at peace with others, especially if\xa0we think they are the ones who need to learn something from us.\nMost of the time, we start from a place of assuming that all of our convictions and thoughts and beliefs are correct. This is why we cannot help but correct those who disagree with us, because they are, of course, wrong.\nAs my friend Joshua Lawson puts it: \u201cThe funny thing about my worldview is that it\u2019s always right, no matter how many times it changes.\u201d\nWhat we need to do is to recognize the authenticity of the other person. We need to admit that they are as sincere in their beliefs as we are in ours. We need to, honestly, love them as we love ourselves and consider them better than ourselves and worthy of love and respect, regardless of their viewpoints or doctrines.\nIt doesn\u2019t mean we have to blindly accept everything they say as the Gospel. But it does mean we at least need to start from the assumption that we may have something to learn, and maybe this conversation could be an opportunity to grow in our understanding.\n\n\nIf nothing else, it could be an opportunity to mature in our faith and our expression of Christlike love for another human being.\nIf we emphasize what we have in common \u2013 which in the Church is our love for Jesus \u2013 rather than hammering on what separates us, we have a better chance of really learning something about one another. And who knows, we might possibly even experience a new insight for ourselves in the process.\nWhat do you think?\n**\nNOTE: This post was inspired by a podcast at \u201cYou\u2019re Not So Smart\u201d.\nListen to the original interview with\xa0Lee Ross here>\n**\n\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

42,Why Do I Partner With People I Disagree With?,"January 24, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nOne of the things I love most about the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast [which I co-host with two other authors] is that every episode we get to model what it looks like for Christians who disagree to actually listen to, respect and genuinely love one another \u2013 even when we disagree on some very fundamental doctrines and ideas.\n\n\nFor example, one of my co-hosts, Jamal Jivanjee, believes that Christ is in everyone, that Jesus never talked about himself, and that Mary Magdalene had more intimate revelation about Christ than Paul or the other Apostles did.\nI believe none of those things.\nJamal also wrote a book a few years ago called \u201cFree to Love\u201d that I completely disagreed with, and I even wrote a pretty harsh critique of that book \u2013 both on my personal blog and on Amazon. He and I even had a video conference call about it where we tried to hash out our differences on the specifics. But, in the end, we both remained unconvinced of the other\u2019s views.\nFast-forward a few years and now he and I are co-hosting a podcast together. How can that be?\nHonestly, when I first started this podcast with Jamal and Matthew Distefano, I got private messages from several friends wanting to know why in the world I would do a podcast with Jamal. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy whose book you thrashed,\u201d they said. \u201cHow can you work with him knowing that he teaches things you don\u2019t agree with?\u201d\n\n\nTurns out, Jamal got almost the exact same sort of messages from his friends that wondered how he could possibly work with someone like me who had publicly criticized his book.\nHere\u2019s the deal: I never criticized Jamal. Even in the actual review of the book, I spent a very large amount of time at the very beginning of the article stressing that I loved Jamal and that I was not against him as a person. My critique was not of Jamal, it was about the ideas in his book that I didn\u2019t agree with.\nWant to know something even more awesome? Our co-host Matt had no idea about any of this. He never detected any tension between us or suspected that there was anything like this in our past. We even had to record a special episode of the podcast just to explain it.\nI love that. Why? Because it proved that Jamal and I were not pretending to love one another and respect one another, in spite of our differences. We really did love one another and mutually agreed to set those differences aside in order to work together.\nHere\u2019s the scoop: I have learned so much from Jamal over the years. I don\u2019t agree with a lot of what he says, but at the same time, I\u2019ve actually been very blessed to listen to him share his thoughts and insights.\n\n\nI\u2019d like to think Jamal would say the same of me, and of Matthew.\nIn a similar way, I have another friend, Chuck McKnight, who also blogs here on Patheos, and I\u2019ve quoted him quite extensively in my last two books. He\u2019s a brilliant thinker, an insightful theologian, and an excellent writer. I\u2019m so honored to know him and to call him my friend.\nBut Chuck has also shared a lot lately about being Polyamory and that\u2019s something I honestly have to admit I don\u2019t understand. Not at all.\nChuck and I are currently writing a book together based on his excellent blog series on The Beautiful Gospel of WHEAT. So far, it\u2019s been an amazing experience and I cannot wait to publish this and share it with everyone.\nBut, if I\u2019m honest, there was a moment when I wondered if co-writing a book with Chuck might be a bit dangerous for me because of the association it might create between us. I had to take a moment to consider the implications of putting my name alongside his on the cover of a book. But, to be honest, I didn\u2019t hesitate very long. Here\u2019s why: Because I love Chuck McKnight and I respect him and I do not doubt his heart for a moment. So, just because he and I have different views on things, it\u2019s no reason to break away from him.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I published \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201c, author Greg Boyd was kind enough to write my Foreword. In my earliest interviews about the book, people asked me if I embraced Open Theism the way Greg Boyd did. They were looking for guilt by association. As if I couldn\u2019t love and respect Greg as an author and embrace some of his ideas while rejecting others.\nBottom line, we don\u2019t have to agree on everything to work together, or to listen to and learn from one another.\nNow, this isn\u2019t always a two-way street, unfortunately. For example, I quite often recommend the teaching, books and ministries of people like Steve Gregg and Jon Zens and a few others, who do not agree with me on everything. In fact a few of those have outright called me a heretic and warned people to stay away from me. That\u2019s unfortunate, but it doesn\u2019t change the way I feel about them, or their ministry. I still love their books and continue to support their work.\n\n\nAs far as it depends upon me, I will love and respect my brothers and sisters in Christ \u2013 even if they disagree with me, or if I disagree with them.\nHow can we possibly learn anything if we only associate with people who agree with us?\nAnswer: We can\u2019t.\nWe have to be open to listen to new ideas, and to love and embrace people whether or not they espouse ideas we find agreeable.\nIf we can learn to do this, I think we\u2019ll start to grow in maturity, and quite honestly, set a better example to the world of what it looks like to love one another as Christ loved us.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

43,Fear? Not!,"January 23, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\n\u201cAnd he said to the human race, \u201cThe\xa0fear\xa0of\xa0the\xa0Lord\u2014that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.\u201d (Job 28:28)\n\u201cNow let the\xa0fear\xa0of\xa0the\xa0Lord\xa0be on you.\u201d (2 Chronicles 19:7)\nAll throughout the Old Testament scriptures, we see this idea of the Fear of the Lord invoked as a metaphor for observing the Lord\u2019s commands, or observing the Law.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important for us to understand that the idea was not so much about literally having a sense of terror concerning the idea of God, but more about the notion of having reverence for God\u2019s wisdom and taking the commandments of God very seriously.\nUnfortunately, most of us have grown up being told that we must literally fear God and that if we do not, then we are not only foolish, we are probably not really one of God\u2019s children.\nThis is nonsense.\nFirst of all, this idea of fearing God is largely an Old Testament concept. The phrase appears 21 times in the Bible, and only one of those references is in the New Testament. All the others are found in the Old Testament, and as already mentioned, have more to do with reverence for God\u2019s law than actual feelings of fear towards God.\nAnother way to understand how often we have misunderstood this phrase is to observe how God reacts to those who literally fear Him.\nOver and over again in both the Old and the New Testament we have examples of God appearing to people \u2013 either in the form of angels, or in visions or dreams \u2013 and in pretty much every single case the very first words spoken are: \u201cFear not!\u201d or \u201cDo not be afraid.\u201d\n\n\nFor example:\n\u201cAfter this, the word of the\xa0Lord\xa0came to Abram in a vision: \u201cDo not\xa0be\xa0afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.\u201d (Gen. 15:1)\nGod heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, \u201cWhat is the matter, Hagar? Do not\xa0be\xa0afraid. (Gen. 21:17)\n\u201cThat night the\xa0Lord\xa0appeared to him and said, \u201cI am the God of your father Abraham. Do not\xa0be\xa0afraid, for I am with you\u2026\u201d (Gen. 26:24)\n\u201cBut the\xa0Lord\xa0said to him, \u201cPeace! Do not\xa0be\xa0afraid. You are not going to die.\u201d (Judges 6:23)\n\u201cThis is what the\xa0Lord\xa0says\u2014 he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you: Do not\xa0be\xa0afraid\u2026\u201d (Isaiah 44:2)\n\u201cDo not\xa0be\xa0afraid, Daniel.\u201d (Daniel 10:12; 19)\n\u201cThe angel said to the women, \u201cDo not\xa0be\xa0afraid\u2026\u201d (Matt. 28:5)\n\u201cBut the angel said to him: \u201cDo not\xa0be\xa0afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard.\u201d (Luke 1:13)\n\n\n\u201cBut the angel said to her, \u201cDo not\xa0be\xa0afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God.\u201d (Luke 1:30)\n\u201cBut the angel said to them, \u201cDo not\xa0be\xa0afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.\u201d (Luke 2:10)\n\u201cWhen I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: \u201cDo not\xa0be\xa0afraid. I am the First and the Last.\u201d (Rev. 1:17)\nNow, why do you think this is?\nIsn\u2019t it because God realizes that we are prone to fear Him and that this isn\u2019t the way God wants us to relate to Him?\nWhy else would the very first words spoken by God or His messengers be: \u201cFear not!\u201d\nMaybe it\u2019s related to what the author of 1 John tells us about fear:\n\u201cThere is no fear in\xa0love. But\xa0perfect\xa0love\xa0drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made\xa0perfect\xa0in\xa0love.\u201d (1 John 4:18)\n\n\nSo, on one level, fear may have its purpose. Fear of punishment for disobedience may keep you performing a certain way, but it\u2019s a poor excuse for a relationship.\n\n\nNow that Christ has come and revealed who the Father really is, we can relax and realize that there is no need to fear our Abba. He is patient, and kind, and merciful, and full of infinite love for all of His children.\nOnce we recognize that we are already loved and accepted by God, there is no longer any reason to fear. Now, we can start to relate to God the way God has always wanted: Love!\nIf you\u2019re still standing in fear of God, you should know that this is not the way God wants it to be. God would say to you exactly what He said to every other person He has ever revealed Himself to: \u201cFear not!\u201d\nYou are loved. There is no fear in love.\nThe fear of the Lord may be the beginning of wisdom, but the love of God is the beginning of life in Christ.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

44,Debt Forgiveness vs Ransom Payment,"January 19, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nThe Christian idea of the Atonement is quite often a collection of mixed metaphors. We sometimes talk about being redeemed from our sins, or say that Christ paid our debt on the cross. But sometimes we also say that God has forgiven our sins and erased our debts. So, which is it?\nAs my friend Chuck McKnight points out, forgiving a debt is not the same thing as paying ransom. Either you pay someone what you owe them, or they just forgive the debt and you pay nothing. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\n\nHere\u2019s how Chuck explains it:\n\u201cThroughout the New Testament, one of the most important themes is that of God\u2019s forgiveness of our sins:\n\u201cIn him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us.\u201d (Ephesians 1:7\u20138, NRSV)\n\n\u201cHe has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.\u201d (Colossians 1:13\u201314, NRSV)\n\n\u201cI am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven on account of his name.\u201d (1 John 2:12, NRSV)\nAnd even in the Old Testament we see this theme come through:\n\u201cIf you, O Lord, should mark iniquities,\n\u2003Lord, who could stand?\nBut there is forgiveness with you,\n\u2003so that you may be revered.\u201d (Psalm 130:3\u20134, NRSV)\nBut according to penal substitutionary atonement, God is unable to simply forgive sins. In this paradigm, God\u2019s \u201cjustice\u201d is such that he cannot allow sins to go unpunished. So the only way he can \u201cforgive\u201d our sins is to punish Jesus instead of us. But this is not forgiveness at all, nor is it truly justice.\n\n\nTo forgive someone means to release them from their debt. If they are released from their debt, then there is no longer any need for payment to be made. Alternatively, if payment is made, then there is no longer any need for forgiveness. You can either have payment or you can have forgiveness, but you cannot have both.\nGod would be well within his rights to demand payment for sins. But if God demanded payment for sins, then he could not also forgive them. If God punished Jesus in our place, then we would no longer need to be forgiven, and the whole concept of God\u2019s forgiveness would be a sham.\nBut Jesus reveals a God who truly does forgive sins. On several occasions during his ministry, Jesus drew the ire of the scribes and Pharisees by forgiving sins on God\u2019s authority, and not once did he also demand punishment for them (Luke 5:20, 7:48, 23:34, etc.).\nFurthermore, Jesus taught his disciples to always forgive those who sin against them, up to seventy-times-seven times (Matthew 18:21\u201322). Did he mean for his disciples to offer forgiveness only if they also received payment? Of course not! Such a notion is quite obviously absurd when applied on a human level. But is it any less absurd to think that our forgiveness ought to be more extensive than God\u2019s forgiveness?\n\n\n\nNo. Jesus shows us that God truly forgives sins, which means that he does not demand payment for them. Jesus\u2019 death on the cross was a crime that we committed. It was not God\u2019s punishment.\u201d [Chuck McKnight; \u201cExhaustive Reconciliation\u201d Blog post]\nI couldn\u2019t agree more with Chuck on this one. What we see in Christ is one who forgives sins automatically. God\u2019s attitude towards sin is simply this: God forgives.\nNotice how the Apostle phrases it:\n\u201cGod was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting our sins against us.\u201d (2 Cor. 5:19)\nAnd furthermore, since we know that God is love, it\u2019s even more scandalous when we read that \u201clove keeps no record of wrongs\u201d in 1 Cor. 13.\nNotice how, when Christ forgives the sins of the lame man lowered through the roof by his friends, he not only does so apart from being asked to forgive, but the people standing around marveled at the authority that Jesus had to forgive sins \u2013 even more so than they were amazed at the power to heal! Notice how they responded: \u201cWhen the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to man.\u201d (Matt. 9:2-8)\n\n\n\n\nWhat \u201cauthority\u201d are they amazed about? The only \u201cauthority\u201d in debate according to this passage was the \u201cauthority to forgive sins.\u201d\nJesus commands us to forgive others when they sin against us. He does so on the basis that this is how God responds when we sin against Him. Because we have been forgiven, we should forgive.\nSo, how does God respond to sin? God forgives sin. Period.\nWe also are encouraged to forgive freely, because we have freely received this same forgiveness.\nForgiveness is not about receiving payment. If we forgive our debtors, it means we do not receive whatever it is we believe they owe us. We just let it go.\nJesus freely forgave sins all throughout his ministry on earth. He even forgave the worst possible sin imaginable \u2013 Deicide \u2013 with these simple words: \u201cFather forgive them. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nWe are all forgiven. Christ has declared us forgiven. God does not count our sins against us. God keeps no record of wrongs.\nOur chains are gone. We are free.\nYou are forgiven.

45,We Are All Inside God,"January 17, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nThere\u2019s an old joke that goes like this:\n\xa0\nOne fish says to another fish, \u201cHow\u2019s the water?\u201d and the other fish says, \u201cWhat the hell is water?\u201d\n\xa0\nThe point is that, to the fish, \u201cwater\u201d isn\u2019t a thing. It\u2019s just the world it was born into. So, it doesn\u2019t know what being wet is, or understand the difference between air and water either.\n\n\n\xa0\nHere\u2019s another analogy: We are all in God. God is inescapable. God is our \u201cwater\u201d and most of us have no idea that we are all surrounded by God.\n\xa0\nThis is odd, especially for Christians, since we have several verses in our Bibles that suggest exactly this; that wherever we go, God is there [see Psalms 139:7-16], and that God is \u201cthe one in whom we all live and move and have our being\u201d [see Acts 17:28].\n\xa0\nTo add another voice to this mix, here\u2019s what New Testament scholar David Bentley Hart has to say about this:\n\xa0\n\u201cLadies and gentleman, we are inside of God. Always. There is nowhere we can go to escape God. Whether in \u201cheaven\u201d or in \u201chell\u201d or any location or state of consciousness we can conceptualize. There is no \u201cseparation\u201d. Ever. No reality can exist in and of itself, or be self-sustained or void of God\u2019s presence. To find one\u2019s self within the realm of being is to find one\u2019s self in the mystery of God, the actualizer and energizer of being. For out of and through and into him are all\xa0things. All things. Which includes all things.\n\n\n\xa0\n\u201cGod is not only the ultimate reality that the intellect and the will seek but is also the primordial reality with which all of us are always engaged in every moment of existence and consciousness, apart from which we have no experience of anything whatsoever. Or, to borrow the language of Augustine, God is not only \u2018superior summon meo\u2019\u2014beyond my utmost heights\u2014but also \u2018interior intimo meo\u2019\u2014more inward to me than my inmost depths.\u201d \xa0\u2013 David Bentley Hart, The Experience of God\n\nSo, I think it\u2019s important for us to try to meditate on this fact and to start to live our lives daily by the light of this idea that we are all immersed and surrounded by God.\n\nNot only this, but if God is love, then we are all \u2013 always \u2013 surrounded by perfect love.\n\nThat\u2019s good news.\n\nIf we are all in God, then there is no one who is ever outside of God, or far from God\u2019s reach.\n\nGod is near to us. Closer than our own breath, nearer than our own heartbeat.\n\n\n\nThis is really good news.\n\nBetter yet, for those who are in Christ \u2013 and I do believe there is a slight distinction in this matter \u2013 God and Christ are both alive within us and have come to live and breathe in us and have made their home with us.\n\nIf Christ lives within us, and if we abide in Christ, then we also have the promise that Christ will never leave us, and will never forsake us.\n\nSo, we are all in God, and if Christ is in us, then we are filled inside and surrounded on the outside \u2013 night and day; 24/7 \u2013 with God and Christ, from now until the end of time and beyond.\n\nI think we\u2019d call that very, very, very good news.\n**\n\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

46,Half of US Christians Have No Idea What The Great Commission Is,"January 16, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nAccording to Barna Research, over half of American Christians have never heard of the Great Commission, and over 37% of those polled couldn\u2019t identify the Great Commission out of a list of various Bible verses.\n\nJust in case you\u2019re in that lower 50%, the Great Commission is found in Matthew 28:18-20 and it\u2019s where Jesus says:\n\n\n\xa0\n\u201cGo into all the world and make disciples of all nations\u2026and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you.\u201d\n\nSo, why is it that so many American Christians have no idea what the Great Commission is?\n\nWell, the most obvious reason is that it\u2019s because our churches are not focused on making disciples, and most alarmingly, our churches are not filled with people who consider themselves disciples \u2013 or followers \u2013 of Jesus.\n\nOur Churches today are largely focused on providing goods and services, light Christian entertainment, inspirational sermons, emotionally-charged worship sets, and a variety of programs designed to keep families with teens and young children coming back week-after-week.\n\nI\u2019m not exaggerating.\n\nThe bottom line is: Christians are not disciples. This is why they\u2019re unfamiliar with the verse where Jesus commands us to make disciples.\n\nFYI: You can\u2019t make a disciples unless you first become a disciple yourself.\n\n\n\nSo, if we\u2019re not following Jesus, we\u2019ll never be able to help anyone else follow him either.\n\nMystery solved!\n\nIf you want to read all the other gobbledeegook from various Seminary professors and mega church pastors about why Christians can\u2019t identify the Great Commission, head on over to Barna Research and knock yourself out. But the simple fact is this: If we are not disciples, we can\u2019t make disciples.\n\nThe survey says what most of us already know: Christians are more interested in arguing and dividing over doctrine than they are in following Jesus and putting his teachings into practice in their daily life.\n\nIt\u2019s also why the church in America looks so little like Jesus and so much like a religious franchise.\n\nOnce you know the problem, fixing it should be pretty easy.\n\n**\n\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

47,Fake Faith,"January 12, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve discovered something that surprised me recently. It turns out that, for most Christians, the hardest thing isn\u2019t loving their enemies or serving the poor, it\u2019s obeying Jesus\u2019 command to love their own brothers and sisters in Christ.\n\xa0*\n\n\n\nOver the last few weeks I\u2019ve witnessed this phenomenon first hand, and it really disappoints me. What I mean is that when another Christian hurts our feelings, or even just disagrees with us about something, most find it easier to just walk away from that person, or even an entire church community, rather than go to that person and try to work things out.\n*\n\nOf course, the question for us shouldn\u2019t be \u201cwhich is easier\u201d, it should be, \u201cwhat does Jesus expect of me?\u201d\n*\n\nSo, instead of telling one another the truth about how we feel, or what we believe, we\u2019d rather just pretend to have unity and fake our faith in the teachings of Christ.\n*\n\nJesus wants us to actually put His teachings into practice. He expects us to leave our sacrifice at the proverbial altar and make things right with one another rather than go through the motions.\n\n\n*\n\nIf we decide to ignore Jesus, it\xa0doesn\u2019t solve anything. It only makes things worse. We carry around our hurt when we show up at the next church fellowship we enter. We begin to mistrust other Christians because we bear a constant reminder of how much it hurts to experience deeper fellowship. We get to be pretty good at faking our emotions, even faking the fruit of the spirit \u2013 joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness and self-control \u2013 rather than actually obey Jesus and allow His Spirit to create these within us for real.\n*\n\nMaybe this is why Jesus commands us to love one another? Maybe it\u2019s why Jesus expects us to make things right between our brothers and sisters? So that those boulders of unforgiveness that are holding back the flood of His Spirit can be removed and we can start to actually live the Christian life and experience the indwelling life of Christ within.\n*\n\nHere\u2019s what I do know: I know that Jesus isn\u2019t glorified when we fake unity. I know that God doesn\u2019t want His children to pretend they are obedient. Pretend obedience is more correctly called \u201cdisobedience\u201d and nothing good can come from this.\n*\n\nI know that Jesus commands us to love one another, and I know that love includes forgiveness and reconciliation.\n*\n\nIf you\u2019re pretending that everything is ok, and you know deep in your heart that it really is not ok, then you need to go and make it right. You need to obey Jesus and make peace. You need to make reconciliation a priority. You need to stop pretending to love people, and start actually loving people. You need to stop faking unity with your brothers and sisters, and start living in actual unity.\n*\n\nBecause who wants to pretend to follow Jesus? Who wants to fake their faith? Who wants to go through the motions?\n*\n\nHopefully, none of us.\n**\n\n\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0Today, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

48,The Beautiful Freedom From Religion,"January 10, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nI was talking with a friend the other day, over Skype, about all the different beliefs I\u2019ve since shed over the years. He remarked to me that his transformation and deconstruction out of religion and into an actual relationship with Christ had created an incredible feeling of freedom, like a giant weight or burden had been lifted from his chest.\n\n\n\nI had to agree.\n\nBut, then I started to wonder about why this is the case. Why do we feel so free when we jettison doctrines like Eternal Conscious Torment? Why do we experience a sense of elation and joy when we discover that God really IS like Jesus, and not like Zeus or some other angry, vengeful, wrathful, violent Deity?\n\nI would suggest that we experience a sense of freedom in these cases because those who created these ideas and doctrines did so specifically to manipulate and control us.\n\nSimply put: Following the teachings of Jesus makes for a pretty lousy religion. [That\u2019s why most Fundamentalists and Religionists love the Apostle Paul much more].\n\nJesus asks us to love one another as he has loved us. This alone should be our only focus. Failure to love in this way should be our only definition of heresy.\n\nBut, early on, leaders looked for short cuts to control the people in their assembly. Fear was the easiest way to do that, and unfortunately, it caught on.\n\n\n\nFor example, John Chrysostrom and Basil \u2013 two pre-Augustinian Christian leaders \u2013 were both drawn to the doctrine of Eternal Suffering for one simple reason: It worked to keep people in line because of the fear it generated.\n\nOther doctrines that benefit from this fear-factor are \u201cThe Wrath of God\u201d, \u201cThe Rapture\u201d, \u201cTribulation\u201d, \u201cLosing Your Salvation\u201d, \u201cThe Unforgivable Sin\u201d, etc.\n\nNone of these doctrines are relevant to you if you understand that Jesus is the clearest possible picture of what God is really like \u2013 and has ALWAYS been like.\n\nIf you recognize that the doctrine of Eternal Suffering wasn\u2019t the dominant view in the Church until after the time of Augustine in the Fourth Century, and that most of the verses used to support it are actually misunderstandings of Jewish Apocalyptic Hyperbole (and not actually about what happens to us after we die), then almost all of these fears disappear. What remains is a secure realization that everyone is loved by God, forgiven by God and welcomed by God into His eternal embrace.\n\n\n\nThat is the sort of thing that resonates with what Jesus said about how the truth sets us free, and how it is for freedom that we are set free and how if Christ sets us free, then we are free indeed!\n\n[Insert freedom and feelings of joy, elation, acceptance and endless love here]\n\nReligions are fueled by fear and thrive on control. Jesus came to set us free from fear. His perfect love totally obliterates fear, \u201cbecause fear has to do with punishment, and the one who lives in fear has not been perfected by love\u201d (See 1 John 4:18)\n\nSo, if you haven\u2019t already done so, I\u2019d encourage you to abandon fear. Refuse to be controlled by it. Resolve to live by love and to experience the freedom that only comes through Christ.\n\nYou\u2019ll be so glad you did.\n**\n\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\n\n\nToday, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

49,Love Is A Person,"January 6, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nLove isn\u2019t a concept. It\u2019s not a feeling. According to the Bible, love is a person, and that person is God.\nIn the first epistle of John we read:\n\xa0\n\u201cThe one who does not love does not know God,\xa0for God is love.\u201d (1 John 4:7-9)\n\n\n\xa0\n\u201cGod is love, and the one who abides (lives) in love abides in God, and God abides in him.\u201d (1 John 4:15-17)\n\xa0\nAs I was reading through the first epistle of John recently I realized that there\u2019s not much debate about the topic of love. See, once you establish that God is love and then you point out that we are commanded by Jesus to love one another, and to love those who do not love us in return, there\u2019s only one thing left to do \u2013 love others.\n\xa0\nDebating love and analyzing love and creating a strategy for love is mostly useless. Other than actually practicing love, there\u2019s not much else to do about it. Maybe that\u2019s why there are so few debates about these little epistles by the Apostle John?\n\xa0\nSo, God is love. This means that love\u2019s origin is God. Apart from God there is no love. And by \u201clove\u201d here we do not mean the earthly, selfish, conditional love that most of us have grown up with. No, we mean the ultimate expression of love that is expressed in the Greek language as \u201cAgape\u201d. It is a love that is unconditional. It is a love that is based on the character and nature of the One who is loving, not on the one who receives that love.\n\n\n\xa0\nIn the Gospel of John, we read where Jesus proclaimed:\n\xa0\n\u201cIf you have seen me, you have seen the Father.\u201d (John 14:9)\n\xa0\nPaul places an exclamation point on that by saying:\n\xa0\n\u201cFor in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form.\u201d (Colossians 2:8-10)\n\xa0\nThat means that if God is love, then Jesus is also love.\n\xa0\nSo, to know \u201clove\u201d we have to get to know the person, Jesus, who is love incarnate.\n\xa0\nIt also means that if we are like Jesus, then we will be loving as He is loving. That\u2019s why He said,\xa0\u201cThey will know that you are my disciples (followers) if you love one another.\u201d (John 13:35)\n\xa0\nWhen we obey Jesus in this area of love we declare that we belong to Him, and we also express to Jesus that we love Him in return.\n\n\n\xa0\nLove is not an emotion. It is not a feeling. It is a person. His name is Jesus. Get to know Him.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nToday, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

50,Why I Prefer To Rock the Boat,"January 5, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for me to receive private messages or texts from friends and followers who are upset about the things I write about. In fact, it\u2019s an almost daily occurrence.\n\nSometimes the notes I receive are quite positive and affirming. Those are the kind that keep me going, to be honest. But, often, the messages I receive range from gentle rebukes to all-capped accusations of being a false teacher who is leading young Christians astray, usually followed by a request for me to repent of my sins.\n\n\n\nRecently, I received an email like this from someone I dearly love and know in the real world [not just in social media cyber-land], and it was [thankfully] closer to the gentle rebuke side than the angry, judgmental type of message. Still, it made me realize that I probably need to publicly address this every once in a while, if nothing else just to make sure everyone knows I\u2019m aware of these concerns that certain people may have and that I have actually prayed about this and thought long and hard about the pros/cons of posting articles that challenge the status quo.\n\nFor the record, I\u2019ve been posting articles like this several times a week for the last 11 years now. So, this isn\u2019t my first rodeo [as one of my friends like to say].\n\nI\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve gotten a lot better about stirring the pot over the years. For example, in the beginning I used to purposely write headlines and use language designed to provoke a reaction from readers. I thought that I needed to shock people \u2013 even piss them off a little bit \u2013 in order to get them to stop and read my posts. From there, I reasoned, I could engage them in meaningful dialog.\n\n\n\nBut, I quickly learned, this was not always a good idea.\n\nWhat actually happened was that the people who engaged with me online were usually so angry at me and so filled with actual rage that they couldn\u2019t really listen to what I was trying to say. I spent more time trying to defuse their emotions than talking about what I really wanted to talk about.\n\nSo, eventually, I got smart. Instead of trying to provoke people to anger, I decided to ask questions that invited real thoughtful engagement. At least, that was my plan. Sometimes it worked, but sometimes even the asking of the question was enough to set people off. Still, this worked much better than intentionally provoking people to anger.\n\nAnother thing that has happened over the years is that I tended to allow certain people who were most emotionally triggered to stick around on my page. Rather than delete people who called me a heretic or accused me of being a false teacher, I let them stay and continue to attack me. Why? Because my plan was to love them in spite of their hateful attitude towards me. I saw this as an opportunity to show them the love and respect that they were refusing to show me.\n\n\n\nSometimes this worked, but often it didn\u2019t. Why? Because not all of my followers on social media got the memo about loving the trolls and blessing those who curse me.\n\nPartly these people \u2013 who usually agreed with me \u2013 were trying to defend me against those who were on the attack. And I appreciated that. But, in the process, they ended up matching the same level of hate and anger that was being aimed at me, and that wasn\u2019t very productive.\n\nSometimes those who were most angry at me had a change of heart. This is why I continued to tolerate their abuse, to be honest. The few examples I had of those who had eventually apologized to me and even written to thank me for loving them in spite of our disagreements was enough to make me want to keep the angry people around a bit longer than most of my followers found comfortable.\n\nNow, I do also realize that these arguments on social media are potentially damaging to the faith of those who read along. I get that. Trying to balance the good with the bad here is tricky.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve had twice as many people tell me that they appreciated the grace I\u2019ve shown my attackers than I\u2019ve had people come and say they were hurt or offended by the dialog. So, once again, because of this ratio I\u2019ve continued to allow disagreements as long as they don\u2019t get too volatile.\n\nWhere I do draw the line is when those who attack me start to attack my friends. If that continues I usually unfriend and/or block those people. My skin is a bit thicker than most of my followers, and they didn\u2019t sign up to be anyone\u2019s punching bag, so I try to keep them away from the hate whenever I can.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the deal: I don\u2019t like the arguments, but what I dislike more is the perpetuation of wrong ideas about who God is, what the Gospel is all about and what Jesus actually said and did.\n\nTo me, those ideas are toxic, dangerous and frankly part of what\u2019s wrong the Christianity in the world today. To me, there\u2019s nothing else worth writing about, or arguing about if it comes to that. Not that I enjoy the arguments, but that I think we need to think a bit harder, and take much more seriously our discipleship to Christ and our witness to the world \u2013 not merely by what sorts of conversations we have on social media, but most importantly by the kind of life we live and the message we proclaim about Jesus, the Gospel and the nature of God.\n\n\n\nSo, if my choices are to sit quietly and avoid rocking the boat \u2013 because some Christians tend to get hateful whenever someone questions their beliefs or challenges their pet doctrines \u2013 or to make an attempt to correct those toxic teachings, then it\u2019s probably obvious what choice I have made: I will not stay silent.\n\nFor some, this decision is a deal-breaker.

51,Jesus Never Claimed To Be The Only Way to Heaven,"January 3, 2019",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nImage: Pixabay\nWe hear this all the time: \u201cJesus is the only way to heaven\u201d or \u201cNo one will be saved without knowing Jesus.\u201d\n\nBut is that true? Well, not quite.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s not what Jesus meant when he said: \u201cI am\xa0the way, and\xa0the truth, and\xa0the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\u2026\u201d (John 14:6)\n\n\n\nNow, most of us have been told that this is what Jesus means to say in this verse, but a careful study of the entire chapter reveals something a bit different.\n\nFirst of all, this statement is in response to the question asked by Thomas, \u201cLord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Jesus said, \u201cI am the way\u2026\u201d\nThe way to where? The way to where he is going.\nWhere is Jesus going? He\u2019s going to the Father.\nSo, this entire chapter is about coming to the Father, not about going to Heaven after we die.\n\xa0\nAfter this, Jesus goes on to explain that if you\u2019ve seen him, you\u2019ve also seen the Father. So, the entire point of the conversation is about knowing the Father.\n\xa0\nNotice also that Jesus provides some evidence for us that the Father is in him, and that he is in the Father: His works.\n\nThen notice that Jesus immediately pivots to emphasize that, if we trust in him we will also do the same works he has been doing.\n\n\n\nWhy is that important? Because the works that Jesus does are evidence that the Father is in him. So, the works that we do are also evidence that Jesus (and the Father) are in us.\n\nThe whole conversation is about coming to the Father, and what it means to be in Christ, and about Jesus going to \u201cprepare a place for (us)\u201d, so that where Jesus is, we may also be.\n\nSo, if we keep reading in this same chapter we will notice that Jesus reemphasizes this same idea over and over again:\n\n\u201cIn that day you will know that\xa0I am in my Father, and\xa0you in me, and\xa0I in you.\u201d (v.20)\n\n\u201cAnd I will ask the Father, and he will give you another\xa0Helper,\xa0to be with you forever,\xa0even\xa0the Spirit of truth,\xa0whom the world\xa0cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and\xa0will be\xa0in you.\u201d (v. 16-17)\n\nThe point is: Jesus is going to the Father. This is what he\u2019s talking about in the beginning of the chapter. The disciples get confused, so Jesus explains that he is going to the Father, and he is the way to the Father because the Father is in him, and the plan is for us to have the Father \u2013 and Jesus \u2013 living in us so that \u201cwhere they are we may also be.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, where is Jesus? Jesus is with the Father. (v. 12; 28)\n\nAnd where is the Father? He, and Jesus, have now come to make their home in you and in me. (v. 23)\n\nNotice that Jesus says, in the previous chapter, \u201cWhere I am going, you cannot follow now,\xa0but you will follow later.\u201d (Jn. 13:36)\n\nThat\u2019s what sets up the conversation in chapter 14 about where Jesus is going, why, and how we can also follow him to the place he is going (to be with the Father).\n\nSo, this idea of being with the Father, and abiding in Christ, (who abides in us and in the Father), is something we can all experience RIGHT NOW!\n\nWe don\u2019t need to wait until after we die to be where Jesus and the Father are. In fact, this is the entire point of Jesus\u2019s going away! It was to prepare a place where we can be together with him and the Father.\n\nNote: Jesus is NOT talking about where we go after we die. Jesus is talking about how we can know him, and the Father, BEFORE we die!\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s quite a significant difference.\n\nJesus is the way to know the Father. He is the truth about who the Father is, because if we\u2019ve seen him we\u2019ve also seen the Father. And Jesus is our source for life \u2013 right here and now \u2013 as we abide in him, and he \u2013 and the Father \u2013 abide daily in us.\n\n**\n\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nToday, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

52,Paul\u2019s 3 Phases of Universal Reconciliation,"December 29, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nIn 1 Corinthians 15:28, Paul outlines 3 phases in the life-giving reconciliation of all things to God:\n\nChrist\u2019s resurrection from the dead\nThen, the salvation of those who are found in Christ\nFinally, the full completion of universal reconciliation after everyone has passed through the fire (See 1 Cor. 3:10-15)\n\n\n\nHe affirms this again in Romans 5:18 where he says:\n\u201cSo, then, just as by one transgression unto condemnation for all human beings, so also by one act of righteousness unto rectification of life for all human beings; For just as by the heedlessness of the one man [Adam] the many were rendered sinners, so also by the obedience of the one [Jesus] the many will be rendered righteous.\u201d (Romans 5:18-19)\nAs New Testament Scholar David Bentley Hart says in his commentary regarding this verse:\n\u201cFrom the context, one can tell what [Paul] is saying: that just as one transgression (or the transgression of one man) brought condemnation to all human beings, so by one rectifying act (or the rectifying act of one man) all human beings receive a rectification of life (meaning either a rectification of their lives, or a rectification imparted by the life of the risen Christ)\u2026the strict proportionality of the formulation, however, is quite clear, here and in the surrounding verses: just as the first sin brought condemnation and death to absolutely everyone, so Christ\u2019s act of righteousness brings righteousness and life to absolutely everyone. Whether intentional or not, the plain meaning of the verse is that of universal condemnation annulled by universal salvation.\u201d [The New Testament: A Translation, David Bentley Hart, pg. 297-298]\n\n\nSo, without the writings of Paul, there would be no grounds for any conception of universal reconciliation. Yet, many still refuse to see this teaching even though it is all throughout Paul\u2019s writings.\nFor example:\n\u201c\u2026we have set our hope on the living God, who is the savior of all men, especially of those who believe.\u201d (1 Tim. 4:10)\n\u201cFor no man can lay a\xa0foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\xa0Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver,\xa0precious stones, wood, hay, straw,\xa0each man\u2019s work will become evident; for\xa0the day will show it because it is\xa0to be\xa0revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test\xa0the quality of each man\u2019s work.\xa0\xa0If any man\u2019s work which he has built on it remains, he will\xa0receive a reward.\xa0\xa0If any man\u2019s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet\xa0so as through fire.\u201d (1 Cor. 3:11-15)\n\n\nAt the heart of this discussion is the question of the fire of judgment that all must pass through. What is the nature of this fire? What is the purpose of God\u2019s judgment?\nDoes God punish for the sake of punishing? Is there no other point to this except to cause pain and exhale an endless fury against sinners? Hardly.\nHebrews gives us some insight into the purpose of God\u2019s discipline and punishment:\n\n\u201cMy son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,\xa0Nor\xa0faint when you are reproved by Him;\xa0For those\xa0whom the Lord loves He disciplines,\nAnd He scourges every son whom He receives.\xa0It is for discipline that you endure;\xa0God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom\xa0his\xa0father does not discipline?\xa0\xa0But if you are without discipline,\xa0of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.\xa0\xa0Furthermore, we had\xa0earthly fathers to discipline us, and we\xa0respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to\xa0the Father of\xa0spirits, and\xa0live?\xa0\xa0For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He\xa0disciplines us\xa0for\xa0our\xa0good,\xa0so that we may share His holiness.\xa0\xa0All discipline\xa0for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterward it yields the\xa0peaceful fruit of righteousness.\u201d (Hebrews 12:5-12)\n\n\n\n\nSee? God disciplines those He loves. Who does God love? The whole world [see John 3:16]. Who does God discipline? Everyone! We will all pass through the fires of God\u2019s judgment, according to 1 Cor. 3:11-15, but the purpose of that fire is to purify us, not to destroy us, or to torture us. God does not torture His children.\nGod disciplines us for our good [see Heb. 12:10 above]. Why? \u201cSo that we may share His holiness.\u201d\nGod\u2019s fire is what cleanses us and purifies us.\nAre any without the Lord\u2019s discipline? Not according to Hebrews 12:8 which says that \u201cwe have all become partakers\u201d of God\u2019s discipline.\nGod, as revealed by Jesus, is our loving \u201cAbba\u201d who wants nothing more than to receive us in his open arms and prepare a feast for us to share.\nHe has not counted our sins against us. [See 2 Cor. 5:19]\nHe has reconciled all things to Himself. [2 Cor. 5:18]\nHe \u201cmakes all things new\u201d again, and that includes every single one of us. [See Rev. 21:5]\nHe calls to those outside the gates of Heaven and invites them to come inside and drink freely from the living waters. [Rev. 22:17]\n\n\nThose gates will never be shut, night or day. His invitation is wide open, for as long as it takes, until every single person who thirsts can no longer resist the free waters of life that flow from His throne.\nTruly, one day, \u201cevery knee will bow, and every tongue will gladly confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\u201d [Phil. 2:10-11]\n\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nToday, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\n\n\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

53,Proof Of Concept,"December 28, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nProof of Concept \u2013 Definition: The evidence that a product, technology or an information system is viable and capable of solving an organization\u2019s particular problem. A proof of concept is often developed for new products that have not yet come to market.\xa0\nAt the core of the Gospel is the idea that a person can be transformed by the power of the resurrected Christ and indwelled by the Holy Spirit of the Living God to become a new creation; a person capable of loving the unlovely, forgiving the most vile and serving others as Jesus did.\n\n\nIn the early days of the Christian faith this theory was proven true in the lives of the disciples who suffered persecution without retaliation, shared everything they owned with people in need, and were known for their radical compassion, astounding love and uncommon inclusivity.\nSomewhere along the way our message got circumvented, the idea of living ones\u2019 life after the pattern of Jesus became supplanted with a softer approach where one need only agree with a set of beliefs and doctrines in order to call oneself a \u201clittle Christ\u201d.\nThe fruit of that original tribe of Jesus followers was quite unlike the fruit we see of today\u2019s Believers. In the first few hundred years it was unheard of for a Christian to take another human life. In fact, we have no known record of such a thing occuring, even from Pagan sources. Today there are hundreds of such examples.\nIn the early Church it was unheard of for a Christian to ignore the poor. Today it\u2019s all too common for the Church to spend billions of dollars on new buildings and pastoral salaries and large-screen plasma screens, and give less than 2 percent of the offering to the poor.\nIn the early Church, no one was coerced to tithe or to give anything. They gave freely and with gladness to care for anyone who had need. In fact, the Christian church didn\u2019t institute a mandatory Tithe until nearly 700 years after Christ, surviving mainly on the charity of the people and being served by leaders who took no salary from the money received.\n\n\nIn the early church, Christians were primarily concerned with preaching the Gospel, making disciples and caring for the poor. Today, Christians are primarily concerned with gaining political power, promoting their specific local church, attracting new tithers and finding a larger building.\nIn the early Church there was no segregation of age, sex, race, music preference, ethnic background, or anything else. Everyone who named the name of Christ was immediately a fully functional and valued member of the Body of Christ.\nIn today\u2019s Church we separate children from youth, youth from singles, singles from young married and young married from the elderly. We also separate from one another by theology, doctrine, practice, worship preference, race, and style.\nIn the early Church the followers of Jesus were simple, humble and loving people. They did not politically oppose the oppressive Roman government or pagan religions of the day. Instead they chose to rebel by living counter to their culture and learned to live radical lives of love within the community.\nIn the early Church, there was no one place where the Church could be located because they did not see the building they gathered in as sacred or holy. Instead, they saw that they, themselves, were holy and sacred by the Blood of the Lamb and the trasformative power of Christ.\n\n\nIn the early Church there was no one special day when they stopped what they were doing to worship God. Instead they gathered daily to break bread, fellowship, and devote themselves to the teaching of Jesus. To them, worship was seen as a way of life where each Believer continually submitted themselves to Christ as a living sacrifice.\n\n\nIn the early Church, Love was the only Law. They were not concerned in any way with amassing wealth, becoming politically powerful, changing laws, or selling products with their church name, cross, or scripture verse attached.\nIn the formative stages of this Christian faith it was the proof of concept that convinced people that the Gospel was true, and in spite of the high cost of following Jesus, many hundreds of thousands of people risked everything to identify with Christ.\nThe proof of a concept is something that must be demonstrated outwardly for everyone to see. If it cannot be demonstrated, it is rejected as false and another concept must be found which can accomplish the task.\nOur lives as followers of Jesus prove, or disprove, the truth of the Gospel. When it comes to the Christian faith, people are looking for a proof of concept and, so far, they\u2019re not very impressed by what they see.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nToday, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

54,Incarnation of Love by Mary Emily Duba,"December 26, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\nNOTE: Today\u2019s post is my transcription of a 2010 interview with Mary Emily Briehl Duba, in which she reflects on the incarnation as God\u2019s act of peacemaking. This interview is a companion piece to her chapter, \u201cPeacemaking and Nonviolence,\u201d in\xa0On Our Way: Christian Practices for Living a Whole Life\xa0(2010), a book that invites emerging adults to explore \u201ca way of life overflowing with God\u2019s justice, mercy, and love\u201d (from the Introduction).\xa0This video is one of thirteen interviews with the authors of\xa0On Our Way, all of which can be found by searching for \u201cOn Our Way\u201d at\xa0www.theworkofthepeople.com\n\n\n\xa0\nThe Incarnation \u2013 by which we mean \u201cGod coming to dwell with us in the person of Jesus\u201d \u2013 is God\u2019s radical act of peacemaking. God subverted every expectation humankind had for what peace would look like; what the Messianic expectation was. The people of Israel were expecting a warrior King. Someone who would come to save the people through a military victory over their enemies and rule as this righteous warrior King. God subverted their expectation by coming in the form of a vulnerable and dependent infant.\nFor Christians, peacemaking begins with the body of Christ; with this child Jesus who has subverted every expectation we have for what peace \u2013 \u201cshalom\u201d \u2013 will look like.\nShalom is this state where \u201call is well\u201d; where people have access to the food they need, the healthcare they need, the opportunity for just relationships with one another and with God and with the Earth. It\u2019s more than what we think of as \u201cpeace\u201d. It\u2019s more than a cease fire. More than a starry night and songs around the campfire. It\u2019s something much more holistic. Much more grand and whole. It\u2019s God\u2019s vision for the Universe as God created it to be. So the work of peacemaking, the practice of peacemaking, really begins there.\n\n\nIt\u2019s about imitating Christ who is \u201cthe revolutionary face of the God of nonviolence.\u201d I love that because it really encapsulates that this person of Jesus, this reconciling activity that God is doing in Jesus, is more than what we could have expected. It subverts our inclinations towards violence. And it subverts our idolatry of fear. That we would raise our fears to a level of an idol. That we would need to respond violently because we are so afraid. Because violence does reign in our world. And that\u2019s a reality that we can\u2019t escape. But we have the opportunity as Christians to choose not to idolize our fear. To choose instead to worship the One God who made heaven and earth and whose vision for us is \u201cshalom\u201d.\nJesus tells a parable about a woman who puts just a little bit of yeast into a bowl of many measures of flour \u2013 enough for many dozens of loafs of bread \u2013 and says, \u201cThis is like the Kingdom of God\u201d.\nSo, I think about yeast as this tiny little speck of life, this little growth that, even though it is tiny it can give life and leaven to the whole batch. So, I like to think of our acts of peacemaking \u2013 the Body of Christ in the world \u2013 as this little bit of leaven that, as small as it may seem in a world that is so incredibly violent, in a world that is at war, it is enough and more. It will give life and leaven to the whole creation. God has promised that it will be so. That what is small \u2013 these daily acts of peacemaking; those moments where we chose to not to say what we might have said, not to send the email that might have damaged a relationship, not to retaliate when we are provoked \u2013those seemingly small choices give life and leaven to the whole bowl of wheat; the whole batch of creation.\n\n\nGod does not come as a warrior king. God comes as a baby. God\u2019s power is hidden under the signs of vulnerability. God comes in poverty. God comes to a young woman who had no status in the community. God\u2019s glory is hidden in the ugliness of our lives. In places of violence, in places of suffering, God is there, hidden among us. This is the theology of the cross. That in the horror of the cross, in the violence, in the ugliness, and the weakness of a man stripped and beaten and hung to die there is something more powerful at work. Hidden under these signs of weakness is the glory of God.\nSo as Christians we refuse to take up what the world sees as signs of power. We refuse \u2013 we don\u2019t always, we fall short in this \u2013 But we want to say, \u201cWe refuse to be oppressors. We refuse to be dominators. We refuse all of the signs in the world that make for power.\u201d\n\n\nInstead, we choose weakness. We choose vulnerability. We choose to love. To have our hearts broken. We chose this because we know that under those signs, in the manger, among the cattle, on the cross, among the poor, God is there. We are not afraid of being poor. We are not afraid of imprisoned. We are not afraid of standing on the side of those who are weak. We are not afraid to be with God\u2019s little ones. Because there is vulnerability, there is the glory of God. Where there is suffering God\u2019s peace is stronger. No matter how hidden it may seem. In death, there is abundant life.\n\n\nGod has already done the radical, the subversive revolutionary act of peacemaking and reconciliation in Christ. God has made peace between God and Creation. There\u2019s no bigger gulf than that. There\u2019s no bigger disconnect than between the Divine and the Human. All we have to do is make peace among human beings.\nGod has done the radical thing. We just have to live into that promise.\n\u2013 Mary Emily Duba\nMary Emily Briehl Duba (PhD \u201918, University of Chicago;\xa0MDiv \u201909, Yale Divinity) is now Visiting Assistant Professor of Theology at the University of Dubuque Theological Seminary and a Louisville Institute Postdoctoral Fellow.

55,Is The Resurrection Unnecessary?,"December 21, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\n\u201cIf the only way we know Jesus is by reading about him in the Bible, then the Resurrection is unnecessary.\u201d \u2013 Gabriel Gordon\n\xa0\nI had the most fascinating conversation with my friend Gordon the other day, and he made the comment above, which really struck me in a profound way.\n\xa0\n\n\nHe and I were discussing our relationship with the Bible, the concepts of inerrancy and infallibility and what it means to say that the Scriptures are \u201cInspired\u201d or \u201cGod-breathed.\u201d In the process of examining the claim that the only way we know Christ is through reading the Bible, he made the above statement and I think it\u2019s pretty dead on and to-the-point.\n\xa0\nIt reminded me of another conversation I had earlier this year with someone at a Conference which was all about Jesus, the Bible and the Holy Spirit. One of the co-presenters at the event looked at me and said, \u201cI have never heard the voice of God other than through the Bible. Jesus does not speak to me apart from the Scriptures.\u201d\n\xa0\nMy response to that was: \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that \u2013 based on your experience \u2013 you believe that God only speaks through the Bible. But, you\u2019re only saying that because you have never experienced Jesus apart from Scripture. Do you see the irony? You\u2019re arguing that we don\u2019t encounter Jesus through experience based on your experience that Jesus hasn\u2019t spoken to you in that way before. It\u2019s your experience\xa0\xa0of non-experience that convinces you that we cannot experience Jesus any other way than through the Bible.\u201d\n\n\n\xa0\nHe didn\u2019t get it. But, he\u2019s not alone. I\u2019ve come to realize that there are quite a few Christians out there \u2013 maybe the majority \u2013 who have never had an encounter with Christ or experienced the Presence of God or felt the Holy Spirit move over them in any way. That\u2019s not only sad, it\u2019s pretty much a direct violation and denial of what the Scriptures actually speak of.\n\xa0\nSee, we\u2019re intended to know Christ in a very real, personal and experiential way. Not merely through information or \u201cknowledge\u201d but by intimate and direct contact with the Divine.\n\xa0\nPaul goes on and on about this in Ephesians chapter 3 when he talks about praying that we would have the power to grasp just how high and wide and long and deep is the love of Christ for us, and how this kind of love transcends knowledge [mere information] to become an experience that transforms us from the inside out. [See Ephesians 3]\n\xa0\nJesus also goes on and on about this when he talks about how we should abide in him and he [and the Father] will come and make their home in us, and how eternal life is defined by \u201cknowing God and His Son whom He has sent\u201d, using the word \u201cGinosko\u201d which is the word for an intimate sexual encounter between a husband and a wife, with the implication being that we should \u201cknow\u201d God in such a deeply experiential way that a new life is conceived in us and we become pregnant with the indwelling presence of Christ.\n\n\n\xa0\nThis, my friends, is about so much more than mere information. It is most definitely about an experiential transformation that is expressed in the resurrection life of Christ birthed within us.\n\xa0\nSo, when my friend Gabriel said that this idea of only knowing Christ by reading about him negates the need for Christ\u2019s resurrection, he is right on several levels. Because Christ is alive today, we can experience Him in a very real way. Because of the resurrection, we can hear His voice, know His presence, encounter His Spirit and experience His life in our own. Not only that, His resurrection means that we can do so much more than read information about Christ, we can draw nearer to Christ and find our identity in Christ and become transformed by Christ.\n\n\n\xa0\nI realize that not many Christians today have ever really experienced Christ in this way, but I do believe that it is exactly what Christ came for, and is, in fact, truly longing for with each and every one of us.\n\xa0\nSo, how can we begin to experience Christ in this intimate way? I\u2019d suggest starting with silence. Being still to know that God is with you is a great place to begin the process of becoming aware of God\u2019s constant presence. Beyond that, wait and see what thoughts come to your mind. Listen for His voice. Wait on Him to move and to speak. If you don\u2019t \u201chear\u201d anything, that\u2019s ok. Sometimes it\u2019s just wonderful to bask in the peace and presence of God without either of you saying a word.\n\n\n\xa0\nTry it. What do you have to lose?\n\xa0\nNot much, and you have so much more to gain by experiencing Christ the way you were always intended to.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nToday, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

56,Unwrapping Presence,"December 17, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nIf Jesus was called \u201cEmmanuel\u201d which means \u201cGod with us\u201d, and if he promised never to leave us or forsake us, then Christ is with us now.\n\xa0\nIf Christ is the one in whom we all live, and move, and have our being, then we are all surrounded \u2013 every moment of every day \u2013 with Christ.\n\xa0\n\n\nIf God is love, then we are always enveloped in this love; night and day, awake or asleep, all day, every day.\n\xa0\nIf God is our peace, our hope, our life, our joy, and our strength, then we are all wrapped in God\u2019s eternal peace, hope, life, joy and strength.\n\xa0\nIf nothing can ever separate us from the love of God which is available to us all through Christ, then this means we will never \u2013 ever \u2013 know what it\u2019s like to exist without God\u2019s love. In fact, we will only know what it\u2019s like to experience the love of God in greater measure and deeper intensity.\n\xa0\nThe arms of our Abba are forever wrapped around His children. Nothing will ever change this.\n\xa0\nSo, even if you don\u2019t feel this love, it\u2019s all around you. Even if you don\u2019t realize God\u2019s presence, it is an ever-present and constant reality.\n\xa0\nEven if you don\u2019t believe in God, this love remains upon you. Even if you don\u2019t accept this love, it is available to you every moment of every day of your life.\n\xa0\nGod\u2019s presence is inescapable. God\u2019s love is irresistible.

There\u2019s a gift for you, over there in the corner. It\u2019s got your name on it. Your real name. Not the one they call you. A name that only comes alive when it flows from God\u2019s mouth and resonates in your chest.\n\xa0\nSon. Daughter. Beloved.\n\xa0\nThis love is unlike anything you\u2019ve ever known before. It\u2019s more wonderful than your mind can comprehend. This love transcends all human understanding.\n\xa0\nBut that\u2019s ok, because a love like this doesn\u2019t need to be analyzed and understood. It just needs to be experienced. It needs to be tasted like the finest wine, or the sweetest fruit. It\u2019s like a song that stops you in your tracks, brings tears to your eyes, inspires you to sing, to dance, to wrap yourself in the moment and pray that it never ends.\n\xa0\nThis love is a gift.

57,Why Paul Literally Takes the Old Testament Figuratively,"December 17, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\nOne of the more refreshing things about reading David Bentley Hart\u2019s excellent translation of the New Testament is how often his notes reflect an entirely different set of suppositions than most of us have been handed by our pastors and Sunday School teachers over the years.\n\n*\n\n\n\nFor example, reading through 1 Corinthians chapter 10 \u2013 where Paul uses examples from the Old Testament scriptures to provide examples to the church in Corinth about how they shouldn\u2019t murmur, or gossip, or complain as the Hebrews did when they wandered in the desert \u2013 you may run across this verse where Paul says:\n\n*\xa0.\n\n\u201cNow these things have become typological figures for us, so that we may not lust after evil things, as ended those men lusted.\u201d [v. 6]\n\n\xa0.*\n\nOr, even further down where he says:\n\n\xa0.\n\xa0*\n\u201cNow these things happened to them figuratively, and were written for the purpose of our admonition, for whom the ends of the ages have arrived.\u201d [v. 11]\n\n\xa0.\n\xa0*\n\n\nAnd, then you may scroll down and follow this footnote where Hart tells us:\n\n\xa0.\n\xa0*\n\u201cAs should be obvious, Paul frequently allegorizes the Hebrew scripture; the \u201cspiritual reading\u201d of scripture typical of the Church Fathers of the early centuries was not their invention, nor just something borrowed from pagan culture, but was already a widely accepted hermeneutical practice among Jewish scholars. So it is not anachronistic to read Paul here as saying that the stories he is repeating are not accurate historical accounts of actual events, but allegorical tales composed for the edification of readers.\u201d\xa0[The New Testament: A Translation, David Bentley Hart, pg. 336]\n\n\xa0.*\n\nWhat\u2019s more, you might also find yourself reading this verse in Galatians where, after Paul uses the lesson about Abraham\u2019s two sons to point us to the differences between the\xa0Old and the New Covenants, he says:\n\n\xa0.*\n\n\n\n\u201cThese things are told allegorically.\u201d [Galatians 4:24]\n\n\xa0.*\n\nAnd below this you might find Hart\u2019s notation that reads:\n\n\xa0.*\n\n\u201cAgain, one should not assume that Paul does not mean precisely what he says, and takes the tale to be essentially (not merely secondarily) allegorical. His interpretative habits are rarely literalist.\u201d [The New Testament: A Translation, David Bentley Hart, pg. 376]\n\xa0.\n\xa0*\n\nSo, if you take Paul\u2019s word\u2019s at face value, what you come away with is that Paul \u2013 a Pharisee of Pharisees, taught by Gamaliel, and a student of the Hebrew Scriptures par excellence \u2013 read the Old Covenant scriptures not as literal historical accounts of actual events, but as figurative parables written to teach us certain lessons and morals.\n\n\xa0.*\n\nThe reason, of course, why I find this so refreshing is that I am daily bombarded by Christians who argue that Jesus and Paul believed the Old Testament Scriptures were historical events and literally true. As if the fact that Jesus references Noah means that he believed the flood was an actual event, or the fact that Paul references the exodus means he believes everything about it was literally true.\n\n\xa0.*\n\nOne can use a story to teach something without believing it to be historical or literal. As when your Pastor references something about Aslan or quotes Gandalf to make a point, or when anyone refers to a scene in the Matrix or Harry Potter to remind us of an important truth. These are not powerful lessons because they are true; they are powerful because we can clearly see the point through the lesson of the story that we all remember and share in common.\n\n\xa0.*\n\nWe can value the Scriptures, and love the truth it contains without believing it to be completely historical or literally true. Don\u2019t believe me? Just look at Jesus and Paul, and most of the early Church Fathers who never took the Scriptures literally, but always took them seriously.\n\n\xa0.*\n\nThe Old Testament can still be inspired without being infallible or inerrant. The same way a song can be inspired and point us to a higher truth about life, or about God, or about ourselves and no one asks if the song is infallible or inerrant because that is the wrong question. God has spoken to us through Scripture, and through songs, and nature, and art, and by His Spirit, but none of these avenues need to be considered literal to be true, or historical to be profound. It\u2019s the truth itself that is valuable, not the historicity of the story, or the literalness of the illustration.\n\n\n\n\xa0.\n**\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\n\n\nToday, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

58,The Savage Sword of Jesus?,"December 14, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nSometimes you have to switch tactics to make your point.\nFor the last few years I\u2019ve been trying to help American Christians understand who Jesus is and that He isn\u2019t a Pro-War, American Capitalist. I\u2019m not making much progress, it seems.\nBut then I ran across this article about a new comic book being created called \u201cThe Savage Sword of Jesus\u201d and it sounded like what some American Christians believe. [This is not a joke]\n\n\nHere\u2019s a little about the comic from an interview with writer Grant Morrison over at Vulture Magazine:\n\u201cIn an interview with Vulture, Morrison revealed his idea for this controversial take on Jesus Christ came\u2026when he uncovered a Nazi project called Positive Christianity, which \u201crecast Christ as a proactive Aryan rather than a meek Jew.\u201d The title and physical look of the Messiah are inspired by a \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d series.\u201d\n\u201cObviously, I had done a lot of research for that one, and I just came across this interesting idea that during the Second World War, the Nazis had attempted to rebrand Christianity, and rebrand Christ, specifically. Take him away from the gentle and peace-loving character of the Gospels, and to transform him into a Nordic and brutish and violent Messiah.\u201d\n\u201cThe idea of stories being changed to fit a narrative rings true with Morrison, especially in this current political climate: \u201cWe\u2019re living in a time when it\u2019s quite clear how even the most pacifist stories or narratives that one time were a lot more positive, can be perverted to stand in as catalysts for violence and mayhem. Especially now that we live in a world where we\u2019ve seen that lies can easily be overlooked, and where celebrity culture is more powerful than the truth, and where people can quite happily twist any narrative to suit any new narrative, and almost twist narratives into their complete opposites, which is what the Nazis tried to do with the Gospels.\u201d",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/12/the-savage-sword-of-jesus/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
59,How Universalism Allows Us To Freely Love As Christ Intended,"December 14, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve noticed an interesting phenomenon. Those who embrace the Universalist View of Salvation tend to be more loving and accepting of those who are unlike them.\n\nHere\u2019s why I think this happens: Because when you realize that everyone is equally loved by God, and that God is really intending to bring everyone to repentance, and that, one day, every knee will bow and every tongue will gladly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, well, you kind of relax and enjoy being alive.\n\n\n\nSee, instead of seeing people as \u201cSaved\u201d or \u201cLost\u201d, or grouping everyone you meet into the \u201cChristian\u201d or \u201cNon-Christian\u201d category, you start to see people as\u2026people.\n\xa0\nNot only do you see people as human beings who are just like you, you also start to see them as God sees them. You start to recognize that everyone you meet \u2013 regardless of their beliefs or spiritual condition \u2013 is someone God loves dearly. You also start to realize that everyone you meet is indeed your brother or sister, and you recognize that we all have the same Heavenly Father. [See Paul\u2019s statements to this effect when he preached to the idol-worshipping pagans in Athens].\n\nThat really changes the way you view the world and other people. Trust me.\n\nNow, I get it, most Christians [at least in the West] do not embrace \u2013 or even understand \u2013 the doctrine of Patristic Universalism. Which is kinda odd since the majority of Christians who followed after Jesus and the Apostles fully embraced the notion that every human being on earth would eventually find their home in Christ.\n\n\n\nMost Christians don\u2019t realize that, from the very beginning, there have always been 3 different views of the afterlife: Universalism, Annihilation, and Eternal Suffering.\n\nWhat most Christians also do not realize is that Eternal Suffering was the minority view, along with Annihilation. Eternal Suffering only gained prominence after later theologians like Augustine championed the view and because the doctrine itself originated in Rome. (And we all know how Rome influenced Christianity post-Constantine).\n\nHere\u2019s a little history lesson to bring you up to speed:\n\u201cThe earliest system of Universalistic theology was by Clement of Alexandria who was the head of the theological school in that city until 202 A.D. His successor in the school was the great Origen, the most distinguished advocate of this doctrine in all time.\u201d\xa0(From the New Schaff-Herzog Christian Encyclopedia, page 96, paragraph 2)\n\n\u201cIn the first five or six centuries of Christianity there were six known theological schools, of which four (Alexandria, Antioch, Caesarea, and Edessa, or Nisibis) were Universalist; one (Ephesus) accepted conditional immortality; one (Carthage or Rome) taught endless punishment of the wicked.\u201d\xa0(From the New Schaff-Herzog Christian Encyclopedia, page 96, paragraph 3)\n\n\nDownload the PDF here:\xa0 [The info quoted is at the bottom, left corner of the text.]\n\xa0\nSo, out of the 6 known theological schools, four of them were Universalist and only one taught Annihilationism (or Conditional Immortality) while another school taught Eternal Suffering.\n\nAdditionally, Augustine admitted in his own day that the majority of Christians believed Universalism:\n\n\u201cIt is quite in vain, then, that some\u2013indeed very many\u2013yield to merely human feelings and deplore the notion of the eternal punishment of the damned and their interminable and perpetual misery. They do not believe that such things will be. Not that they would go counter to divine Scripture\u2014but, yielding to their own human feelings, they soften what seems harsh and give a milder emphasis to statements they believe are meant more to terrify than to express literal truth.\u201d\xa0(Augustine,\xa0Enchiridion, sec. 112.)\n\nAnd by \u201cvery many\u201d, Augustine meant, \u201cthe vast majority.\u201d\n\n\n\nNotice, also, that Augustine graciously conceded in his statement that those who believed Universalism did so without going \u201ccounter to the divine Scriptures\u201d (even if they came to different conclusions than he did).\n\nAnother fascinating tidbit is that, of those early Christian teachers who did teach Eternal Suffering, there stated reasons for WHY they embraced this minority view was quite simply, \u201cfear.\u201d\n\nIn other words, those early Church Fathers who taught Eternal Suffering did so because they found it very effective in evangelism, and because the fear of eternal torment helped to keep people in line.\n\nTwo of those, pre-Augustine, were Basil and John Chrysostrom.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit about why they valued the doctrine of Eternal Suffering:\n\n\u201cBrian Edward Daley, in\xa0The Hope of the Early Church, remarks that Basil was \u201can admirer of Origen in his younger days\u201d (81) and was closely familiar with his work. However, in his later years he became \u201cmore severe in his own expectations of the future\u201d and\xa0found the teaching of judgment valuable for the spiritual development of Christians.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLike Basil, Chrysostom saw eschatological themes as a crucial part of his preaching ministry\u2026Chrysostom explains the need for such eternal punishment elsewhere. For example, in his\xa015th homily on 1 Timothy,\xa0he emphasizes the value of fear in constraining sin:\n\xa0\n\u201cSince the greater part are virtuous from constraint rather than from choice,\xa0the principle of fear is of great advantage to them in eradicating their desires. Let us therefore listen to the threatenings of hell fire, that we may be benefited by the wholesome fear of it.\u201d\n\xa0\n\n\nFear and control are poor reasons for embracing a doctrine. Especially when we have the advantage of seeing what a few hundred year\u2019s worth of this teaching can do to people\u2019s faith.\n\n\n\nHundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people have abandoned the Christian faith over this doctrine which portrays God as a vengeful, wrathful Deity who cannot love or forgive unless there is blood spilled and a sacrifice made. Many others have avoided the Christian faith completely for the very same reason.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is when you realize that such an offensive doctrine has very little scriptural support. In fact, most of the verses that are referenced to bolster this view of the tormenting God are either using Apocalyptic language from the Old Covenant prophets \u2013 which were never about actual eternal worms, or fire, or smoke, but always about literal armies that would come to invade a city or a nation \u2013 or are verses that speak of \u201cdeath\u201d or \u201cdestruction\u201d, not about being eternally alive to experience the fires of hell.\n\nOf the three views, only Annihilation and Universalism have any real legs to stand on, and neither of those two views paints God as a monster who requires blood and sacrifice, or who tortures his enemies without mercy.\n\n\n\nSo, as I said in the opening paragraphs, I\u2019ve realized that abandoning this primitive, and frankly false doctrine of eternal suffering, leads to a changed perspective about your fellow man, and about the God that is revealed to us in Christ.\n\nI highly recommend a study of this topic. It has been very encouraging for me, and I know that being set free from the fear of endless torment can really do wonders for your view of God, and your love for your fellow man.\n\nI think it\u2019s time to forsake the false doctrine of eternal suffering and embrace the God who has \u201creconciled the world to Himself, not counting our sins against us.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t you?\n\n-kg\nWANT TO STUDY MORE ON THIS TOPIC?\nI recommend part two of Steve Gregg\u2019s excellent series: \u201cThree Views of Hell\u201d on\xa0MP3 here>\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nToday, He and his wife live in Meridian, Idaho, awaiting their next adventure.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.\xa0\nBONUS: Want to unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more?

61,What\u2019s So Great About Constantine?,"December 7, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nIf you listen to any Bible Scholar or Christian teacher long enough and you\u2019ll no doubt hear something \u2013 good or bad \u2013 about Constantine.\n\xa0\nSome think he was God\u2019s gift to the Church \u2013 because he helped to end persecution against Christians and gave Christianity legitimacy in the Roman Empire.\n\n\n\xa0\nOthers doubt the sincerity of his conversion experience \u2013 because the Jesus in his vision only showed up to bless his battle plans and helped him to kill lots of those who opposed the Roman Empire. [And that doesn\u2019t sound like the Jesus we see in the Gospels].\n\xa0\nStill others say that Constantine introduced hierarchy into the Church, giving more prominence to the Bishop, and later to the Pastor after the Reformation.\n\xa0\nAnd, still others add that Constantine also merged the Church with the power of the State and entangled Christianity with Empire.\n\xa0\nI agree with all but the first group of people.\n\xa0\nWhat\u2019s more, I also think that Constantine\u2019s influence on the Christian Church was tragic and un-Christlike. He took the Nazarene Movement away from humility, love and service to all, and made it about power structures, hierarchy and the fear-based control of others.\n\n\n\xa0\nUnfortunately, one of the primary ways that Constantine accomplished this dark shift in Christianity was by overseeing the Canonization of Scriptures which were then used to determine who was \u201cin\u201d and who was \u201cout\u201d.\n\nSoon after this is when the church started persecuting Herself. [Ironically, since many embraced Constantine for helping to end Roman persecution of the Church, but then very quickly the Church was doing all the persecuting of Christians, leaving the Romans more free time to oppress the other trouble-makers].\n\nAs my friend, Mike Schellman noted:\n\n\u201cBefore Constantine, Christians made judgments about the legitimacy of certain writings. After Constantine, writings made judgments about certain kinds of Christians. That is not to say that certain outsiders were once insiders \u2013 but rather that no group [previously] had the authority of the state backing up its claim on the truth.\u201d\n\nThis is the key. In the years prior to Constantine\u2019s suspicious \u201cconversion\u201d to Christianity, Christians disagreed about all sorts of things. But, there was a balance of power where no one group had any authority to condemn any other group. Nor is there much indication that they wanted to do so. Remember, all Christians were equally persecuted by the State. So, even if I might disagree with a brother or a sister about the nature of Christ, or the atonement \u2013 or even about which of Paul\u2019s epistles were legitimate \u2013 at the end of the day we were all in the same family of God. The persecution they faced was blind to any particular doctrines. That meant that most Christians were also a bit blind about it, too.\n\n\n\nNow, it\u2019s sadly true that establishing power structures within the Body of Christ was something that had already started to formulate prior to Constantine\u2019s influence. But, once he arrived on the scene, it became another useful tactic to re-fashion Christianity into a club that \u2013 along with a single definition of Orthodoxy \u2013 could be used to beat people into submission.\n\nUnder Constantine, Christianity became more about exercising power over others, whereas previously it had been more about acting in humility and love to exercise a quiet form of \u201cpower under\u201d others.\n\nOnce the Christian Church had power \u2013 the power of the Sword which had previously rested in the hands of the State \u2013 She lost Her true power \u2013 the kind that comes from sincere love, genuine compassion and the miracle of a transformed life.\n\nOrthodoxy quickly overshadowed Orthopraxy as the standard for determining who was \u2013 and who was not \u2013 a Christian. Prior to Constantine, a Christian was defined as someone who put the teachings of Jesus into practice in their daily life. That\u2019s Orthopraxy. But after Constantine\u2019s influence, a Christian was defined by what someone believed, and whether or not they agreed with the doctrines of the \u201ctrue\u201d Church. That\u2019s Orthodoxy.\n\n\n\nFor my money, I\u2019d rather go back to a version of Christianity that is more focused on being Christlike, than on determining who is right and who is wrong about theology.\n\nOne version is a lot closer to what Jesus set in motion. The other smells a bit too much like something a Pagan Emperor might dream up the night before a big, bloody battle against the enemies of the Empire.\n\nGive me Jesus.\n**\nLISTEN to a 2 part debate between myself and Christian Historian Al Baker called \u201cWhat\u2019s Go Great About Constantine?\u201d\n\n\nPart 1\nPart 2\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

62,When God Seems Far Away,"December 5, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nNever underestimate the power of sitting in silence.\nI try to do this at least a few times every week. It helps me to connect with God and gain some much-needed perspective about what really matters in life \u2013 and what really doesn\u2019t.\nThe other day, as I sat in silence, this is what I started to be reminded of by the Holy Spirit:\n\n\n*The Kingdom of God is within.\n*Christ abides in me, and I abide in Christ.\n*Christ is the One in whom I live and move have my being.\n*Jesus promises never to leave me or forsake me.\n*Jesus is \u201cEmmanuel\u201d which means \u201cGod with us.\u201d\n*Jesus said he was going to the Father so that where he is, we could be also.\n*Jesus promised that those who love him and obey him will be loved by the Father.\n*Jesus also said that he, and the Father, would both come to make their home within us.\n*We are as close to God right now as Adam and Eve were in the Garden.\n*We are closer to Jesus than the 12 disciples were.\n*Actually, we are CLOSER than they were to God, and to Christ, because they both have come to live and breathe inside of us and will never, ever leave us.\n*Nothing can ever separate me from the love of Christ.\n*The love of Christ is higher, wider, longer and deeper than I can possibly know.\n\n\n*His love transcends knowledge.\nNow, it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t already know all of these things, mind you. I did. I\u2019ve written and shared on this idea of God living and breathing within us for a long time now.\nBut, to be honest, I needed this reminder.\nLater, I started to think about the wristwatch that my Dad gave me a few months ago. It\u2019s the first birthday gift my Mom gave to him the year they got married.\nIt\u2019s a Bulova; an old wind-it-yourself manual wristwatch that doesn\u2019t have a battery or an alarm. It just basically tells time, and you can\u2019t read the numbers in the dark.\n\n\xa0\nBut, I love it. Not because it\u2019s a great watch, but because it reminds me of my Father every time I wear it, and every time I wind it up.\nThe funny thing is, when my Dad gave it to me a few months ago, he told me it didn\u2019t work anymore and that I would probably need to spend a few hundred dollars to get it repaired. But, once I wound it up and started to wear it on my wrist, it started to keep near-perfect time.\n\n\nI think the key was it needed to be worn and the motion of wearing it, combined with the periodic winding of the watch itself, was all that was missing.\nSo, in a strange way, I think this is a great metaphor for what happened when I sat in silence the other day. All that was required was that I stop and \u201cwind up\u201d my inner watch, and this reminded me of who my Father is, and how much He loves me, and that He is always with me, and that I am His beloved.\nIt matters that we carry around these reminders, in our heart, on our wrist, or wherever necessary, so that we never forget how loved and valued we are by our Abba.\nIt feels great to be loved, I have to admit. And it feels even better to know that this love is endless, and ongoing, and meant to be shared with everyone we meet.\nYou are so loved. Take time to stop and remember that as often as you can.\nAnd better yet, be sure to remember that you are never alone. Even if you may feel like God is a million miles away, the truth is that God is as close as your own heartbeat, and as near to you as your own breath.\n\n\nThis is really Good News. Isn\u2019t it?\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\n \n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus\xa0Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

63,Those Who Trust In Christ Will Die\xa0,"December 4, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nReading through David Bentley-Hart\u2019s New Testament translation each night before I go to sleep has been challenging. Mostly because I tend to discover something I haven\u2019t noticed before and it keeps my mind working all night trying to make sense of it.\nLast night was such a night.\nWendy and I read through chapter 11 of the Gospel of John and there was a notation about an alternate way of rendering Jesus\u2019s words about the fate of those who put their hope in him.\n\n\nHere\u2019s the verse that hit me:\n\u201cJesus said to her, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life;\xa0whoever has faith\xa0in me, even if he should die, shall live,\xa0and whosoever lives and has faith in me most certainly does not die\xa0until the\xa0Age to come.\u201d [v.25-26]\n\xa0Now, most of the popular English translations render this quite differently and leave out the qualifier \u201c\u2026until the Age to come\u201d, but David Bentley-Hart correctly includes the literal phrasing which suggests that what Jesus is talking about is more about the end of the current age and the beginning of the next one. (Not about where we go after we die).\nSo, the implication here, with the new translation, is that those who follow Jesus\xa0will die, but only\xa0after\xa0the end of that current age in which Jesus was speaking. In other words, those who put their trust in Jesus will not die in the present age, but they will live to see the new age to come.\nThis is key because, to those listening\xa0to\xa0him speak, the \u201cend of the age\u201d referred to the \u201cDay of the Lord\u201d which was the\xa0last, great judgment.\nBut, this judgement was not carried out in some mystical heavenly\xa0throne room in the clouds, it was a very real\xa0judgement carried out by literal armies that surrounded Jerusalem and destroyed the temple, the priesthood and ended the daily sacrifice.\n\n\nThis violent end of the age took place on T\u2019sha B\u2019av in AD 70. Those who refused to follow (or to put their trust in) the message of Jesus, were slaughtered by the Roman army. Quite literally, they lived by the sword and therefore died by the sword, as Jesus warned.\nHowever, those who did trust in the cheek-turning, enemy-loving\xa0message of Jesus escaped that\xa0violence. History records that the Christians in Jerusalem were warned to flee months before the Roman army surrounded the city by a series of prophetic words. Because of this, the Christians fled to the nearby region of Pella, across the Jordan river.\nThis is testified to in several places, for example:\n\u201cThe people of the Church in Jerusalem were commanded by an oracle given by revelation before the war to those in the city who were worthy of it to depart and dwell in one of the cities of Perea which they called Pella. To it those who believed on Christ traveled from Jerusalem, so that when holy men had altogether deserted the royal capital of the Jews and the whole land of Judaea\u2026\u201d\xa0\xa0\u2014\u2009Eusebius, Church History 3\n\u201cThis heresy of the Nazoraeans exists in\u2026the region of Pella\u2026 From there it took its beginning after the exodus from Jerusalem when all the disciples went to live in Pella because Christ had told them to leave Jerusalem and to go away since it would undergo a siege. Because of this advice they lived in Perea after having moved to that place, as I said.\u201d \u2014\u2009Epiphanius, Panarion 29\n\n\n\u201cSo Aquila, while he was in Jerusalem, also saw the disciples of the disciples of the apostles flourishing in the faith and working great signs, healings, and other miracles. For they were such as had come back from the city of Pella to Jerusalem and were living there and teaching. For when the city was about to be taken and destroyed by the Romans, it was revealed in advance to all the disciples by an angel of God that they should remove from the city, as it was going to be completely destroyed. They sojourned as emigrants in Pella\u2026\u201d\xa0 \u2014\u2009Epiphanius,\xa0On Weights and Measures\xa015\nSo, David Bentley Hart\u2019s translation confirms my long-held suspicions that when Jesus talks about \u201ceternal life\u201d or \u201csalvation\u201d he is not usually talking about what happens to us after we die. Instead, he is referring to the end of the age that was prophesied by Daniel. He\u2019s referring to the beginning of a brand new age that is marked by the New Covenant that Jesus made with his disciples in the upper room.\nIf we re-read that passage in Chapter 11 of the Gospel of John, we see that Jesus is saying something very practical about the fate of those who trust in his teaching and put it into practice, and the fate of those who refuse to do so.\n\n\nThe end of the age was coming very quickly. As Jesus had promised, it would take place in the lifetime of many of those who were standing with him.\nLet\u2019s break down what Jesus is actually saying now, in context:\n\u201cI am the resurrection and the life;\xa0whoever has faith\xa0in me, even if he should die, shall live\u2026\nMeaning: This is a promise that Jesus is our life. So, for those who die before the end of the age, there is the hope of life beyond this one.\n\u201c\u2026and whosoever lives and has faith in me most certainly does not die\xa0until the\xa0Age to come.\u201d [v.25-26]\nMeaning: Those who don\u2019t die before the end of the age, but put the words of Jesus into practice now, will survive unto the beginning of the next Age. (But they may still die after the Age to come).\nThis reading provides a much more accurate picture of what Jesus was communicating in these verses, I believe.\nSo, either way, those who trust in Christ will die: They will either die before the end of the Age comes \u2013 but if so they are promised life beyond this one \u2013 or they will live until the current Age ends and the new one begins \u2013 but still die after the Age to come.\n\n\n\n\n(Because the promise Jesus makes is that one will not die \u201cuntil the Age to come\u201d).\nThis verse is not ultimately about going to heaven when we die, although there is a hint of that in the first half of the verse. Instead, the overall meaning is that by putting the words of Jesus into practice now, one might sow seeds of peace and reap the life of the age to come.\nEither way, however, death is inevitable. And this should come as no surprise since Jesus also said that no one could follow him unless they first took up their cross daily, died to themselves, and put his words into practice.\nSo, death is assumed from the very beginning.\nPersonally, I am very intrigued by this message and what it meant for those who heard it.\nWhat do you think?\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

64,Forsaking Church As We Know It To Experience Church As God Intended,"November 29, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nSomeone once said that if you want to save something, you first have to destroy it. This was more in the context of art or fashion, mind you, but it does have applications in a few other areas. Like, the Church, for instance.\n\xa0\nChurch as we know it is really more of a recent development in Western culture. It honestly bears very little resemblance to what the original Christians used to practice about 2,000 years ago in Palestine and the surrounding Roman Empire.\n\n\n\xa0\nToday, we can\u2019t imagine Church without a senior pastor who has a seminary degree and does all the speaking once a week during an hour-long service where a rock band plays sing-along worship songs at full volume with the digital projection screens displaying the lyrics alongside the main stage in the warehouse-sized building with the big sign out front.\n\xa0\nEvery single one of those things would be completely foreign to every Christian for the first thousand years of church history. Except for the senior pastor thing. That probably started after a few hundred years, but before that, no one person did all the teaching or talking, and there was certainly no senior pastor in Corinth, or Thessalonica, or Ephesus, or Antioch, etc.\n\xa0\nWant proof? Notice how Paul never wrote any letter addressed to the senior pastor \u2013 or even to pastors plural. Every epistle is written to \u201cthe church in\u2026\u201d whatever region it existed. The church \u2013 the people who followed Christ \u2013 were responsible for practicing the 58 \u201cOne Anothers\u201d which set the Body of Christ apart from every other institution around it.\n\xa0\nThe ekklesia \u2013 or the assembly \u2013 was truly comparable to an organism with dozens, even hundreds, of interconnected and interdependent parts. This is why Paul used the metaphor of a Body in 1 Corinthians to describe how the church functioned. There was one \u201cHead\u201d to this \u201cBody\u201d and it was Christ (not the senior pastor). Every single person was gifted by the Holy Spirit to provide the ministry the rest of the Body needed. Rather than have all of these gifts rest on one single person, or even on a small paid staff of ministers, the early Christians each had a purpose, role and gifting that was essential to the life and growth of the Body.\n\n\n\xa0\nThis meant one amazing thing: Everyone was essential. No one was superfluous or unnecessary.\n\xa0\nLike our own bodies, every organ and member was valued and necessary for the entire body to remain healthy and strong. If your liver or one of your kidneys stopped functioning, your entire body would know it \u2013 and feel it \u2013 deeply.\n\xa0\nWhat\u2019s more, whenever Paul did talk about pastors [plural], as in Ephesians 4:11-13, it was only once, and even then the point wasn\u2019t that those with certain gifts did all of the work of the ministry. On the contrary, Paul says that God gave apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers and evangelists to the church \u201cto equip his people for works of service\u201d and this was \u201cso that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.\u201d\n\xa0\nSo, the early Christians saw themselves as ministers of the Gospel. They were the priesthood \u2013 all of them combined. This is where we get the concept of the Priesthood of All Believers from, although most of us have no idea what it really means or how to actually walk it out.\n\n\n\xa0\nThat\u2019s because no one really preaches about it \u2013 in our new one-teacher-senior-pastor system \u2013 and because even if someone did explain it to us, church as we know it today makes it completely impossible to operate as a Body as Paul describes in 1 Cor. 12.\n\xa0\nSo, if we wanted to actually BE the Church that operates like Paul describes in 1 Cor. 12 \u2013 you know, the Body of Christ \u2013 then we\u2019d have to destroy Church-as-we-know-it and start over with something totally brand new. (At least, \u201cnew\u201d to us, anyway).\n\xa0\nIt\u2019s like that other famous saying: \u201cIf you want something you\u2019ve never had before, you\u2019ll have to do something you\u2019ve done before.\u201d\n\xa0\nMost of us have never used our spiritual gifts to edify an entire room full of other people before. Most of us have no idea what a gathering would look like without a senior pastor telling us all what to do, or what to think, or how to read the Bible.\n\xa0\nFrankly, the idea of coming together to be the church like this scares the living crap out of most people. What if we get off track? What if someone tries to lead us into heresy? What if it\u2019s too hard? Or too boring?\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\nNot everyone is ready for this. Most Christians probably love their home church, and are quite happy with their senior pastor, and their rocking worship band, and their super-cool youth pastor, and the comfy chairs that all face the same direction. They like the sermon and a song version of Sunday morning Christianity. For them, it isn\u2019t broken so they\u2019re not looking for anyone to fix it.\n\xa0\nBut, for a few people, like me, this is not good enough. Church as we know it just isn\u2019t cutting it anymore. There is an itch that cannot be scratched by sitting and listening to one person operate in their gifting while the rest sit silently and nod. For us, church is not a spectator sport. It\u2019s something to be experienced and fully participate in on a daily [not a weekly] basis.\n\xa0\nThose who yearn for something closer to what they read about in the book of Acts, or Corinthians, may have already left their traditional weekly church service. They just can\u2019t sit still for that any longer. Some of them may have already found a few others who are also curious about how to BE the Body of Christ rather than just attend a Church. Others are still searching and praying for the chance to actually experience this Body Life for the first time.\n\n\n\xa0\nMe? I\u2019m lucky enough to have experienced this for the last 11 years of my life. But, after a recent move to a new state, I\u2019m really missing this reality and longing to find others nearby who are hungry to have a meeting with Jesus and not just one about Jesus.\n\xa0\nIf you\u2019re looking for something like this, I\u2019d recommend starting off by either searching for like-minded people on sites like MeetUp.com, or joining a few Facebook Groups like the one I admin for [Organic Church Movements] or possibly the Unchurching group run by my friend Richard Jacobson. Once you\u2019re connected there, you can start asking around to see if there are a few others near you who are looking for the same thing.\n\xa0\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, you just might have to start with just yourself and your spouse, and possibly your kids. Keep praying and searching for others to be added to your number.\n\xa0\nI have to believe there are more people out there who are hungry and thirsty for something like this. We just have to find one another.\n\xa0\nUntil then, be patient, keep praying, and trust that Jesus will build His ekklesia as He promised.\n\n\n\xa0\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

65,Our Divine Potential,"November 29, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nThe question usually gets framed as something like: \u201cDo you believe that humans are all born in original sin?\u201d or \u201cDo humans have a sin nature?\u201d\nFor me, the problem is in the question itself. It assumes the answer before anyone can really consider all the variables.\nAs an example, we could factually say that every human being goes to the bathroom on a regular basis. So, does that mean that humans are poopers by nature? Well, yes, but is that our identity? Is that who you are?\n\n\nOf course not. The fact that everyone poops is not a reflection of their nature, or their character. It\u2019s just a fact. People poop. But, who we are is so much more!\nSo, the fact that people have the potential for evil, or even that we all sometimes act in ways that are selfish, or unforgiving, or hateful, or harmful, does NOT mean that this is who we are by nature. Why? Because these same people \u2013 you and me \u2013 are also constantly doing things that are thoughtful, and kind, and selfless, and compassionate, and good.\nIn other words, we all have the potential for both good and evil. We are no less born with a sinful nature than we are with a righteous nature. Everyone has the potential for either, or both, at any given time.\nThe Good News is that we also have the potential to share in the Divine Nature of Christ:\n\u201cHis divine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by\xa0his own glory and goodness.\xa0Thus he has given us, through these things, his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust, and may become participants of the divine nature.\u201d\xa0(2 Peter 1:3-4; NSRV)\n\n\nThis is the other reason I reject the notion of Original Sin, because it keeps us in a pre-Christian state of mind where we are hopeless and helpless to overcome our darker tendencies. The Good News is that Christ empowers us to live (abide) in the life of Christ and learn to participate in his Divine nature.\nIn other words: We all have the potential for both good and bad thoughts/actions, but if we abide in Christ we can start to experience our Divine Potential.\nThe emphasis, then, is not on our sinfulness, or our tendency to fail, but on our awesome ability to be like Christ (which is the whole point of the Gospel of the Kingdom).\nWe are not only called to walk as Jesus did, we are empowered to do so, and have been given \u201ceverything we need for life and godliness.\u201d\nSo, rather than fixate on our sinful potential, the shift we need to make is to focus on our divine potential.\nYou are not a sinner, even if once in a while you sin. You are a child of God who is made in this Divine image, and you have been given everything you need to grow into this new nature today.\n\n\nYou have a Divine Potential. Start living in that reality as soon as possible.\nWhy not right now?\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

66,No Jesus? No Christ. Know Jesus? Know Christ.,"November 28, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nTrying to clarify a bit more how I understand the Christ consciousness, as some call it.\nI\u2019ve already written a few posts recently about how being\xa0Christlike is not the same as being Christ, and about how\xa0Jesus and Christ are synonymous. However, I still feel like there\u2019s one more thing I need to stress: You can\u2019t talk about Christ without talking about Jesus.\n\n\nIn my ongoing dialog with a few of my friends who see Christ as being independent of Jesus, I often hear that Jesus isn\u2019t around anymore, and that Christ wasn\u2019t Jesus\u2019s last name, and other comments that essentially downplay the uniqueness of Jesus as \u201cThe Christ\u201d and emphasize our identity as Christ (or the reality of \u201cChrist in us\u201d).\nAs I\u2019ve said before, I affirm that we are now the incarnation of Christ today, and I agree that Christ dwells in us. I even agree that we are no less \u201cChristlike\u201d than Jesus was, but we may be limited by our development in the Way of Christ.\nFurthermore, I also agree that everyone \u2013 not just Christians \u2013 are \u201cin Christ\u201d as Paul affirms when he preaches to the idol-worshipping pagans in Athens and says:\n\u201cFor in him [Christ] we live and move and have our being.\u2019As some of your own poets have said, \u2018We are his offspring.\u201d [Acts 17:28]\nBut, I would argue that being in Christ is not the same thing as having Christ in you.\nLike an empty water bottle, we can be submerged deep in the center of the ocean of Christ, and in that sense we are all \u201cin Christ\u201d [because we are all surrounded by Christ]. But, until the cap is taken off that water bottle, the ocean of Christ is not in us. We have to consciously open ourselves up to Christ and allow Christ to abide in us \u2013 so we can abide in Christ.\n\n\nNow, after establishing all of this, let\u2019s get back to the original point I wanted to make: Christ is Jesus and Jesus is the Christ.\nFor those who want to argue that Christ isn\u2019t merely Jesus, let me challenge you to describe or conceive of Christ without referring to Jesus. Personally, I don\u2019t think it can be done.\nAs I see it, we only know Christ \u2013 and we only see and experience Christ \u2013 through the living example of Jesus.\nYou could say, \u201cWhat about Gandhi, or Mother Teresa, or Martin Luther King, Jr.? Aren\u2019t they all wonderful examples of Christ?\u201d\nAnd I would say, \u201cYes! But if you look closer you\u2019ll see that all three of them were inspired by the message and life and love of Jesus.\u201d\nSo, without Jesus, none of us would even have any idea of who or what Christ is.\nWe cannot talk about or think about Christ apart from Jesus. If you remove Jesus, then you have no Christ to speak of.\nYes, we can learn of Christ from Jesus, and we can experience Christ in our own life now, but all of this is explicitly because of Jesus.\nSo, for me, Jesus is Christ and Christ is Jesus. I can be filled with Christ because of Jesus. I can learn to embody Christ by following Jesus\u2019s example and teachings. I can even be the incarnation of Christ in the world today [and in fact, this is my purpose and calling as a follower of Jesus].\n\n\nBut I am not Christ. Jesus is the Christ. Christ is revealed to us in Jesus. Jesus Christ can be revealed in me, if I am in Christ and Christ is in me.\nThe reality of what it means to be \u201cin Christ\u201d is a profound and fascinating study, which I invite you to explore in this post: \u201cIn Christ?\u201d\n\n\nWhat do you think? I\u2019d love to hear your comments.\nThanks!\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

67,Christlike (But Not Christ),"November 24, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\nImage: Keith Giles\nThe other day, a friend responded to one of my posts by saying that I reminded him of Christ because of something I did or said. That was a blessing. I honestly do have a very real desire to be like Christ, and so whenever someone says they can see Christ in me, it really means a lot.\n\n\nHowever, after that comment, my friend went on to say that I was Christ, which I think I can honestly say is taking it a bit far.\nNow, I do believe that we \u2013 those who follow Christ \u2013 are not only filled with Christ as we abide in him and he in us, but that we are also agents of Christ in the world today. So, in some ways I would affirm the concept that Christians are intended to be the hands of Christ, the feet of Christ, the Body of Christ, and even demonstrate the love of Christ in tangible ways to everyone around us.\nAll of this is very scriptural. For example:\n\u201cSo we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us\u2026\u201d (2 Cor. 5:20)\n\u201cAnd God placed all things under his (Christ\u2019s) feet\xa0and appointed him to be head\xa0over everything for the church,\xa0which is his body, [that\u2019s us] the fullness of him\xa0who fills everything in every way.\u201d\xa0(Eph. 1:22-23)\n\u201cTo them God has chosen to make known\xa0among the Gentiles the glorious riches\xa0of this mystery, which is Christ in you,\xa0the hope of glory.\u201d (Col. 1:27)\n\n\nBut, there is a big difference between \u201clike\u201d Christ, and being \u201cin\u201d Christ, and being \u201cfilled\u201d with Christ and \u201cbeing\u201d Christ.\nFor example, if someone saw me dunk a basketball over someone\u2019s head with my tongue sticking out, they might say: \u201cWow! You dunked that ball just like Michael Jordan.\u201d\nThat would be true. I would have done this \u201clike\u201d Michael Jordan, but to take that further to say that I \u201cam\u201d Michael Jordan would be so very, very false.\nIn fact, it\u2019s impossible to be \u201clike\u201d someone and also \u201cbe\u201d someone. In the example above, if Michael Jordan dunked a basketball over someone\u2019s head, they would not say: \u201cWow. You\u2019re just like Michael Jordan.\u201d\nNo, they would say, \u201cHey, you ARE Michael Jordan!\u201d\nMichael Jordan is Michael Jordan. He is not \u201clike\u201d Michael Jordan.\nI may be \u201clike\u201d Christ whenever I am abiding in Christ and showing the character of Christ in my words and deeds, but I am not Christ. Christ is Christ.\nTo put it another way: I may be Christlike, but I will never be Christ.\n\n\nI\u2019ve used the example of a glass of wine to illustrate this before. A wine glass is created to do one thing: Hold wine. So, whenever a wine glass is filled with wine, it is fulfilling its purpose. I may receive wine from the wineglass and I may even praise the glass for being filled with this wine, but no one would ever confuse the wineglass for the wine.\nWe are vessels that are intended to be filled with the fullness of Christ. When we are filled with Christ we begin to love and serve and share and forgive like Christ. In those cases, someone can honestly say \u201cI see Christ in you\u201d, in the same way someone might say \u201cI see wine in that glass.\u201d But the wine is not the glass, and the vessel is not the substance it carries.\nWe are very blessed to be filled with Christ, and it is a great honor to be the hands and feet of Christ to the world around us, but no matter how Christlike we may be, we will never be Christ.\nChrist is our source and the One in whom we all live and move and have our being. Christ is the source of all life, and truth. Christ is our connection to the Divine. But we are not Christ.\nWe are like branches sprouting out of the vine that gives us life, but we are not the vine.\n\n\n\n\nThere is only one Christ. Our greatest aim is to be like Christ.\nIf we were already Christ, there would be no need for transformation.\nLet\u2019s remember this.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

68,Undeserved Love?,"November 21, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\n\nThere we were, sitting in a new church on a Sunday morning. Having just moved to a new town only a month ago, after living in Southern California for 25 years, my wife and I were mostly looking for an opportunity to gather with other Christ-followers. Our long-term plan is still to start another house church family here, but in the meantime, we were just looking for an opportunity to fellowship.\n\n\n\xa0\nSo, the worship set that morning was great. But during the announcements there was something said that really bothered me. The guy up front mentioned that they were putting together Christmas boxes for local school kids as part of an initiative to help less fortunate children. Kinda cool, right?\nWell, as the guy was explaining why the church does this, he said the main reason was \u201cso that we can show these kids some undeserved love.\u201d\nNow, I know what he probably meant by that, but it really bothered me. Like, all day long.\nAs soon as he said it, I immediately wrote in my little notebook the words, \u201cEveryone deserves love.\u201d\nOn the one hand, I can forgive the misspoken sentiment. Assuming it was misspoken. That\u2019s the part I\u2019m not sure of. Because there\u2019s still a chance that the guy making this announcement meant exactly what he said and possibly even chose those words carefully.\nSee, if you think that humans are basically evil, then you probably believe that those children are wretched sinners at heart. At least, the non-Christian kids are.\nSo, you tell yourself that by putting these little gift boxes together, you\u2019re expressing the love of Christ to these kids, and you\u2019re probably also thinking to yourself that the love of Christ is undeserved love.\n\n\nTo be fair, the guy making the announcement (who turned out to be their Senior pastor) probably also believes that Christians don\u2019t deserve the love of Christ either. So, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s looking down on those kids. He may just be looking down on everyone, including himself.\nBut, I really challenge this whole concept that none of us deserves the love of Christ.\nWhy? Well, for one thing because this is never taught in the entire New Testament. Nope. Not once.\nWhat we do see is that the love of God, and the love of Christ is described as being beyond our comprehension, and bigger and taller, and deeper and wider than we can possibly imagine. We\u2019re told that God is love. We\u2019re told that nothing will ever separate us from God\u2019s love, or the love of Christ. We\u2019re told that God\u2019s love is perfect, that God\u2019s love changes us, and that God\u2019s love compels us to love others with the same love we have been loved with.\nBut never, not once, does the New Testament ever say that we do not deserve God\u2019s love.\nThink about it this way: would any parent ever say to their child: \u201cI love you so much. But, you don\u2019t deserve my love.\u201d\n\n\nOf course not. So, if God is a better Father than you or I could ever be, then it\u2019s guaranteed that God would never tell us that we don\u2019t deserve to be loved.\nEveryone deserves the love of God.\nWhy? Because we are made in the image of God. (And God is love).\nBecause we are all the offspring of God. (And what Father doesn\u2019t love his children?)\nBecause God says we are loved. (And what more proof do we need than this?)\nSo, the next time you feel compelled to bless someone who is less fortunate, or to show kindness to a stranger, or even to do something nice for someone in your family, or even for yourself, please, please keep this in mind: Everyone deserves to be loved, and everyone is already loved by God.\nThere is no such thing as \u201cundeserved love\u201d because, like it or not, we are loved with an everlasting love by a God who is love, and who created us to love and to be loved.\n\n\nDon\u2019t you just love that?\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

69,In Defense of Brian Zahnd,"November 19, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nBack in 2015, I posted an article called \u201cNot A Sin?\u201d on my previous blog site called \u2018Subversive1\u2019, after several weeks of showing the post to a handful of people I respected, and especially those who were members of the LGBTQ community. My concerns were two-fold: One, I wanted to be sure that my response was solid from a scriptural standpoint, and Two, I really wanted to be careful not to inadvertently insult or belittle my friends who were not straight.\n\n\n\xa0\nEdits were made based on those conversations, and literally a few of them were actual phone calls where I was extended immeasurable grace for some of the language I had used without thinking about how it would come across to people outside my frame of reference.\n\xa0\nStill, posting that first article on my blog was \u2013 for me \u2013 a very big deal. In a way, I was \u201ccoming out\u201d along with my gay and transgender friends, because I was stepping out of the shadows and standing alongside them, for better or worse.\n\xa0\nAfter that, it got a bit easier to share my thoughts on this subject \u2013 and it is one where I am still really processing and learning and growing, to be very honest.\n\xa0\nBut, even just a few days before I posted that first article, I was not sure where I stood with the topic of gay marriage. My wife Wendy and I would take long walks around the block together and during this time our topic of conversation was very much about this question: Is it ok for gay people to be married?\n\xa0\nNow, I know that for some of you, this isn\u2019t even a question. Of course they should be married! [Well, duh.] But, for someone who is honestly wrestling through the question, it is not really that clear or that easy to answer. In other words, it takes some time to logically, and theologically, cross that line in your heart and mind.\n\n\n\xa0\nSo, just the other day, a friend of mine, author and pastor Brian Zahnd, took some heat from yet another friend of mine, Chuck McKnight, for a Tweet he had made about gay people being fully accepted into the Body of Christ, but mentioning that his church does not perform same-sex weddings. [Full disclosure: Brian Zahnd wrote the Foreword to my latest book, \u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible.\u201c]\n\xa0\nThat article, also posted here on Patheos, was gentle, thoughtful, and sincere \u2013 as many of Chuck\u2019s articles tend to be. [Full disclosure: Chuck and I are currently co-writing a book together for Quoir publishing]. In the response, Chuck was careful to mention his connection to Brian, and to me. I do understand where he\u2019s coming from, and why he felt the need to write this. However, I was disappointed with the overall post \u2013 and mostly with the reaction to the post rather than the post itself.\n\xa0\nReading Chuck\u2019s article made me remember how, early on in my own process and development around this topic, it might have been counterproductive for me to have received a similar rebuke like that one.\n\n\nBut reading the comments and reaction to Chuck\u2019s article gave me even greater pause. I can understand that Brian\u2019s position is hurtful to many people \u2013 especially those in the LGBTQ community who have looked to him as someone they believed was on their side. I get that. I can understand the disappointment and the betrayal they must feel (and Chuck\u2019s article does a great job of shedding some light on that).\nMy concern was mostly with the direction that some of the comments were going and that\u2019s why I felt the need to write this post. Not as a correction to Chuck\u2019s post \u2013 which I love \u2013 but more as another voice in this same, ongoing conversation.\nWhen I was still in the study and research phase of this whole question about LGBTQ relationships, it wasn\u2019t easy to navigate. Honestly, it was the kindness, and the grace that was extended to me by my very patient and loving LGBTQ friends that helped me change my way of thinking on this issue. If I had been blasted for not being all the way across the finish line, I may have decided to give up completely.\n\xa0\nIn our house church family, we developed a mantra of sorts that says \u201ceveryone is in process\u201d and by that we mean that not everyone is on the same page, or in the same place, theologically. So, we have learned to have extreme grace for one another \u2013 especially if we encounter someone who believes something today that we once believed ourselves only a few years (or months) ago.\n\n\n\xa0\nAs for me, I\u2019m mostly very proud of Brian Zahnd for taking the stand that he takes on this issue, because I know that it\u2019s not easy or comfortable to stand where he\u2019s standing. So, he affirms and loves the gay Christians in his own church, and he allows them to participate fully. However, he does not [yet] perform same-sex weddings.\n\xa0\nIs that full inclusion? No. But, it\u2019s also not \u201canti-inclusion\u201d either. It\u2019s an uncomfortable spot in the middle ground, but \u2013 I would argue \u2013 it\u2019s a point along the curve that is bending towards full inclusion.\n\n\n\xa0\nNow, I do hope and pray that one day very soon he may continue to process and progress and eventually he may turn the corner on this issue \u2013 as most of us are hopeful that he will \u2013 but, until that day, I\u2019d rather show support for Brian\u2019s progressive momentum in the right direction, even if he\u2019s not all the way home, yet.\n\xa0\nPlease understand: I\u2019m not saying I agree with Brian\u2019s decision not to perform same-sex marriages. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. Not at all.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is: Let\u2019s affirm the steps that Brian has made so far, and let\u2019s encourage him to continue to think \u2013 and rethink \u2013 this issue in light of Christ and the radical inclusiveness of the Gospel.\n\n\n\xa0\nHowever, if you feel the need to demonize and scapegoat Brian for his failure to have arrived at the same spot in the road where you happen to be, then please remember that there may be areas of your own theology that are as equally underdeveloped and lacking.\n\xa0\nThink about the grace you would like to receive from the rest of us as you make your way down that path, and then try to extend some of that same wonderful grace to Brian Zahnd, and other pastors and teachers just like him, who have made positive steps towards full inclusion, and one day \u2013 with your love and grace \u2013 may soon arrive at the place where you\u2019ve been standing for a while now.\n\xa0\nThat day will be so much sweeter for all of us if we\u2019ve modelled a spirit of love and grace to one another along the path.\nTrust me.\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

70,Childlike Wisdom,"November 16, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nIt was about 9 years ago. I was sitting in the floor of our den, surrounded by our house church family, and one little boy from our neighborhood who had started to join us, along with his even younger brother and sister.\nHis name was Parker, and he was six years old, going on 26. Smarter and sharper and more clever than any other six-year-old I had ever met before.\n\n\nThe first person to greet us when we had moved to this new house, and this brand-new neighborhood, was Parker. He was standing in the driveway when I opened the door to the moving truck and he followed me all day long, and into the evening, as we sat around with our friends eating pizza, surrounded by boxes and moving dollies.\nOne thing I always loved about Parker was his ability to cut through the nonsense and get straight to the point about everything.\nThat particular Sunday, he was asking me rapid-fire questions about God, the Bible, Jesus and pretty much anything that we started to talk about. Not to be disruptive \u2013 at least I really don\u2019t believe so \u2013 but out of a sincere child-like curiosity.\nWe were talking about Creation, for some reason, and Parker started asking about Adam and Eve. \u201cSo, are you saying that every person on Earth came from the same two people?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s what the story tells us,\u201d I explained.\nHe only paused for a quick second and then he said, \u201cThen that means that every single person alive is all from the same family!\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, Parker. We\u2019re all one big family. But we don\u2019t act like it, do we?\u201d\n\n\nParker thought about it a bit longer and then he said, \u201cMaybe people just don\u2019t know about this. I mean, I didn\u2019t know until you just told me!\u201d\nIn that moment, I really wanted to hug him so hard. I wished that more people could grasp this simple, yet profound truth the way Parker just did.\nOut of nowhere, I said, \u201cOnce you know who your Father is, you can never forget who your brothers and your sisters are.\u201d\nSo, then I started to tell Parker the Parable of the Good Samaritan. He got it right away. I didn\u2019t have to explain anything to him. \u201cSo, that Samaritan knew that this man on the road was his brother. That\u2019s why he stopped to help. Those other guys didn\u2019t know about it, but he did.\u201d\nThis is why Jesus said that the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these and that, unless we come to Him as little children, we will never enter the Kingdom of God.\nWe are all one big family. There is no \u201cthem.\u201d There is only \u201cus.\u201d\nI wish more people understood this the way my friend Parker did that day.\nSometimes it\u2019s really good to be reminded of it, even if you thought you already knew it already.\nAt least, I think that\u2019s true.\n\n\nDon\u2019t you?\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

72,The Crowley/Darby Connection,"November 15, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nDispensationalism, the dominant theology of Evangelical Christianity today in America, originated in 1830 with John Nelson Darby. Or, so we might assume. But, recently I came across a bit more evidence of where Darby got his strange ideas about the Rapture, End Times Tribulation, and the identity of \u201cTrue Israel.\u201d\nAs a result, I also uncovered an odd connection between Darby and famed Satanist Aleister Crowley, which is fascinating.\n\n\nFor some background, John Nelson Darby popularized and was largely responsible for the emergence of the doctrine of Dispensationalism in 1830 \u2013 the very same year that Joseph Smith founded \u201cMormonism\u201d, by the way.\nDispensationalism teaches that the Christian church completely misunderstood prophetic passages in the Bible for nearly 2,000 years. Rather than seeing these prophecies \u2013 like Daniel\u2019s \u201cSeventy Weeks\u201d prophecy, the various \u201cDay of the Lord\u201d prophecies in the Old Testament, and the \u201cOlivet Discourse\u201d given by Jesus in 3 of the 4 Gospels \u2013 as being fulfilled in AD 70, this new teaching proposed that these were all about yet-to-be-fulfilled events in the near future.\nYes, in short, this is where we get the incredibly cinematic \u201cLeft Behind\u201d theology about the Mark of the Beast, 666, the Anti-Christ, a Millenial Reign of Christ, the Tribulation, and all the rest.\nBut, whereas Darby may have formulated these views and packaged them as \u201cDispensationalism,\u201d he wasn\u2019t the originator. Instead, it turns out it was all the fever dream of a dying woman named Margaret McDonald in Scotland.\nHere\u2019s the scoop: Around 1820 \u2013 a decade earlier \u2013 there was a Presbyterian minister from London named Edward Irving who believed the church needed to practice the spiritual gifts. Essentially, Irving gave rise to modern-day Pentecostalism. Two years prior to being kicked out of the Presbyterian denomination, Irving was preaching and promoting spiritual gifts at a revival in Scotland. During one of those services, a woman named Margaret McDonald who was deathly ill, came under the power of the Holy Spirit gave them \u201cmingled prophecy and vision\u201d about how the End Times were soon going to unfold.\n\n\nAccording to Margaret\u2019s prophetic word, the return of Jesus would be in two stages \u2013 not one. The first would be a secret rapture for true believers, and then after a period of great tribulation, Jesus would return a second time [or third time?] for all to see.\nThere is evidence that Darby heard of this and, although he was not keen on the spiritual gifts aspect of this movement, actually visited Margaret McDonald\u2019s home to hear firsthand about this brand new prophecy of the end times.\nAs an accomplished theologian, Darby was able to formulate a version of scripture that made all of Margaret\u2019s new ideas seemingly fit together.\nFor this, Darby was himself rejected by his own church, but eventually found support from people like Cyrus I. Scofield \u2013 yes, THAT \u201cScofield\u201d \u2013 the very same person who published the Scofield Reference Bible at the beginning of the 20th\xa0century and helped to spread and popularize Darby\u2019s Dispensational views by inserting notes under key scriptures that bolstered the view.\nBefore long, entire Bible Colleges and Seminary\u2019s were embracing Darby\u2019s Dispensationalism and the damage was \u2013 and is \u2013 done.\n\n\nBut, what does all of this have to do with Occultist Aleister Crowley?\nSimple: Crowley attended Darby\u2019s church as a young boy.\nHere\u2019s a bit of detail taken from a pro-Crowley website for reference:\n\u201cWhen other children attended the Presbyterian church to listen and fantasize about angels with halos, or Moses parting the red sea destroying the armies of Egypt, Crowley sat there transfixed listening to Darby\u2026tell the faithful attendees of the rewards of heaven and the magical rapture. Of the evil and terrible day when those that did not put their trust in Jesus were left behind. Left behind to suffer in the hands of the Antichrist and the Beast; beheading or torture their only way to salvation.\n\u201cAs a boy, Crowley was given a dose of the message that millions of evangelical Christians would listen to in the future. During Crowley\u2019s childhood, The Rapture was not widespread. The End-Time scenario, Rapture, Antichrist and his horrible tribulation, and the gnashing of teeth was not your run of the mill evangelical doctrine but something exclusive to a handful of churches, one which little Aleister Crowley happened to attend.\n\n\n\u201cCrowley rebelled against this absurd doomsday scenario. He was one of the first to do so. He rebelled in an age where this doomsday scenario was not a widespread phenomenon like it is today. I can only imagine what being part of a doomsday cult was like during his boyhood. \n\u201cThe thing is\u2026 we know how Crowley turned out after listening to Darby\u2019s interpretation of the fate of mankind in his early years. Now that the great majority of Protestants believe in the Rapture myth and every doomsday death wish that this entitles them to, I wonder\u2026how many Crowley\u2019s is the modern Protestant movement -basically millions of clones of Darby\u2019s church- creating?\xa0Time will tell. I think Crowley was just the first fruit.\u201d\n\n\nSo, thanks to John Nelson Darby, we not only inherited a wonky end times theology that regularly spawns date-setting \u201cend of the world\u201d predictions \u2013 which always fail, of course \u2013 and an entire cottage industry for those who claim to know the identity of the anti-Christ, or how some future events will bring us inches closer to the return of Christ, we also have Darby to thank for the twisted ideas of Aleister Crowley \u2013 a man often called \u201cone of the wickedest men in the world.\u201d\xa0\n\n\nWho knows how many others like him \u2013 who heard a version of the Gospel that was built on nonsense and inflated into an entire subculture of Christianity that chases signs and peddles a Gospel of fear \u2013 are turned away from the actual message of Christ?\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m not very thankful for that.\n\xa0\n**\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from the organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

73,For God So Hated The World?,"November 9, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nIf Penal Substitutionary Atonement Theory is true, then we need to re-write John chapter 3, verse 16 to say:\n\n\u201cFor God was so filled with wrath against the world, that he sent his only begotten son to take the beating that we all deserved. That if anyone would want to escape eternal suffering, and would raise their hand and repeat this prayer after me, they would escape this horrible wrath. For the son was not sent into the world to change our minds about God, but to change God\u2019s mind about us. So now that Jesus has taken the punishment for us, God can now finally love us, and forgive us.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut\u2026there\u2019s nothing at all like this in the New Testament. Not even close.\n\nIn fact, as I\u2019ve already mentioned in a previous blog, John 3:16 doesn\u2019t even mention the crucifixion at all. It only mentions God\u2019s love for the entire planet, and God\u2019s desire that we put our trust in Christ and not die, but have life.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit more like it, I think.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the idea that God requires the shedding of blood to forgive our sins is not only false, it\u2019s clearly demonstrated to be unnecessary as Jesus forgives sins numerous times in the Gospels \u2013 pre-crucifixion \u2013 and even empowers us to do so.\n\nFor example, check out this exchange in Matthew 9:\n\n[Jesus says] \u201cBut I want you to know that the Son of Man\xa0has authority on earth to forgive sins.\u201d\xa0So he said to the paralyzed man,\xa0\u201cGet up, take your mat and go home.\u201d\xa0Then the man got up and went home.\xa0When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God,\xa0who had given such authority to man.\u201d [v. 6-9]\n\n\n\nDid you catch it? First, Jesus says that he [the Son of Man] \u201chas authority on earth to forgive sins\u201d and to prove it, Jesus heals the man. Then, the crowds \u201cwere filled with awe and praised God\u201d \u2013 why? \u2013 because \u201cGod\u2026had given such authority to man.\u201d\n\nHad given WHAT authority to man? The authority on earth to forgive sins.\n\nNotice Jesus diddly about the shedding of blood needing to come first.\n\nAlso, when Jesus is in the act of being crucified \u2013 but still very much alive \u2013 he asks the Father to forgive them in advance for what they have done \u2013 and are about to do \u2013 to him. All without actually being crucified, shedding blood on the cross, or dying for anyone\u2019s sins.\n\nThe idea that God requires blood and the sacrifice of an innocent victim before God can love, forgive or accept us is archaic, and pre-Christian. It\u2019s an idea that was formulated by ancient people who had barely emerged from idol-worshipping cultures where the gods were seen as fickle and angry and that this anger could only be assuaged by the sacrifice of an innocent animal or sometimes a human being.\n\n\n\nThis is what natives and islanders believed thousands of years ago. We would call those people primitive and perhaps even scoff at their foolish ideas about appeasing an angry god by killing someone, or something.\n\nBut, Christians seem to have no trouble believing that the God of the Bible is exactly the same.\n\nIn spite of the fact that Jesus said no such thing, and even demonstrated the exact opposite: God is love. God\u2019s love for us is endless. God is the Good Father who patiently waits for his children to return to him and rushes out to meet them, and kiss them, and place a robe around their shoulders and a ring upon their fingers and to throw a huge party \u2013 without first requiring us to grovel, or beg, or even to pay him back what we stole, or requiring the torture or death of any living thing in advance.\n\nGod just forgives. It\u2019s how God responds to sin: Forgiveness.\n\nIt\u2019s how God responds to us: Love. Just total and complete, inexplicable love.\n\n\nWhy? Because God is love. It\u2019s just who God is.\n\nReading the Scriptures through the lens of Christ allows us to see a God who does not count our sins against us. It allows us to see \u2013 in Christ \u2013 a God who would rather die than live without us, and who would rather suffer the violence we bring against him than to retaliate against us.\n\nPenal Substitutionary Atonement theory is just that: a theory. It\u2019s also, I believe, a pretty bad one; one that does not square with the character of Christ \u2013 who is the incarnation of God and the exact representation of His being; the one in whom the fullness of God lives in bodily form. [See John 1:1; Heb. 1:3; Col. 2:9]\n\nNow, I realize that I\u2019ve left a lot of questions unanswered here. What about those verses that suggest that Jesus died for our sins? What does that mean? Well, the short answer would be that \u201cdying for our sins\u201d may not mean what we\u2019ve always been told it is supposed to mean. Maybe it means that Jesus died \u201cbecause of our sins\u201d, meaning that we, in our sinfulness, killed Jesus and in this way he \u201cdied [due to] our sins.\u201d\n\n\n\nI think N.T. Wright\u2019s latest book \u201cThe Day the Revolution Began\u201d does an excellent job of unpacking this question. Much better than I could do here [or have done].\n\nAnother question might be: What about the verses in the New Testament [Hebrews for example] that repeat the pre-Christian notion that \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins\u201d?\n\nAgain, the answer to that is quite long and would require an entirely new post. But, in short, I\u2019d say that those verses [especially the one in Hebrews] are used to compare/contrast the Old Covenant with the New Covenant and to point out how Jesus transcends and supersedes those archaic ways of thinking and acting. The overall point is often how Jesus has now put an end to those old ways and abolished those old practices, once and for all. His blood has been shed \u2013 by us, no less \u2013 and now God\u2019s forgiveness is finally, ultimately, and forever poured out over all mankind; from here to eternity.\n\nSo, where was God when Jesus was being crucified? Is God the one holding the hammer? Is God the one pouring out His wrath upon the Son? Not at all. \u201cGod was,\u201d as Paul so beautifully reminds us, \u201cin Christ, reconciling the world to Himself; not counting men\u2019s sins against them.\u201d [See 2 Cor. 5:19]\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the \u201cwrath of God\u201d is a loaded phrase that too many Bible teachers have watered down to mean \u201cGod\u2019s wrath against us\u201d rather than an apocalyptic hyperbole that is always a metaphor for reaping what you have sown and most often revealed when an invading army surrounds your city or defeats you in battle, or takes you and your family as captives.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s a lot more to the Atonement than meets the eye. It\u2019s good to consider some of those other 7 theories of the Atonement that have been around much longer than Calvin\u2019s \u201cPenal Substitution\u201d (PSA) which didn\u2019t exist until the 16th century.\n\nWhat proponents of PSA often fail to recognize is that most of the 7 major atonement theories that have popped up over the last 2,000 years were in response to the dominant theory of the day. So, Moral Influence Theory wouldn\u2019t exist without Ransom Theory, and Christus Victor modifies them both, and Satisfaction Theory wouldn\u2019t exist if Anselm weren\u2019t trying to update and refine Ransom Theory, and Calvin would never have formulated Penal Substitution without the framework of all that had gone before.\n\n\n\nPSA is not the Gospel. It\u2019s a theory. The Gospel? That\u2019s what Jesus says it is. He tells us all about it in the Gospels \u2013 you know, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. It\u2019s very simply the \u201cGood News\u201d [or Gospel] of the Kingdom of God. It\u2019s what Jesus preached. It\u2019s what Paul preached. It\u2019s the only Gospel there ever was, or ever will be.\n\nPlease, don\u2019t take my word for it. Read the Gospels for yourself. Listen to Jesus. Don\u2019t just call Him \u2018Lord, lord\u2019, but please, do what Jesus says.\n\nYou\u2019ll be glad you did.\n\nNOTE: If you\u2019d like to listen to a debate I did this week with my friend on this topic, it\u2019s available HERE.\n\n**\n\n\nKeith Giles was formerly a licensed and ordained minister who walked away from organized church 11 years ago, to start a home fellowship that gave away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

74,Why Sports Tribalism Is Worse Than Other Tribalism,"November 7, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\nI wrote an article recently about the dangers of Tribalism and how Jesus invites us into a Tribe where the leader isn\u2019t tribal and everyone is welcome into the tribe and loved and accepted even if they never join the tribe.\n\n\n\nMost people agreed that tribalism is bad and that Jesus wasn\u2019t tribal, but several people argued that there\u2019s nothing wrong with sports tribalism, and even went as far as to sing the merits of sports as a way to build character, and equip children for success.\n\nI totally disagree.\n\nIn fact, I see sports tribalism as the worst possible form of tribalism, for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, because it is the gateway drug to all other forms of tribalism. It does teach young children and equip them for integration into society, but this integration is tribal, and therefore what it teaches is tribalism, and what it equips young people to do is to think, act, and behave tribalistically.\n\nSecondly, because sports tribalism appears innocuous, on the outside, but on the inside it is just as blind and irrational as any other tribalism.\n\nAs an example, I was riding the train to work one day last year and overheard a conversation between two other riders. One guy was from ST. Louis. The other guy from California was wearing a Rams jersey. He started going on about how great it was that the Rams were back in LA now. The St. Louis guy shared how he now hates the team but used to love them, (back when they were in St. Louis). The LA guy hated them for leaving but now can\u2019t buy enough jerseys and hats for his entire family.\n\n\nThis sort of arbitrary tribalism is so stupid and petty. We \u201clove\u201d a team because now they are \u201cOur Team\u201d, even though a year from now they could become another team somewhere else.\nWhat is it about \u201cour team\u201d we love? The coach? The players? The logo? The mascot?\nWhat we love is simply this: We find part of our identity in that brand and we attach emotionally and we defend the \u201chonor\u201d of that brand even though it has nothing to do with \u201cus\u201d in reality.\nI once posed a question to a friend of mine who is fiercely loyal to his college football team and passionately hates their rival team. \u201cWhat if, by some fluke, the locker rooms for both teams were switched and at the last minute those players had to don the jersey\u2019s for the opposing team and take the field for kick-off? Who would you cheer for: The players from your school who are now wearing the jersey\u2019s of their rivals, or the rivals who are now wearing the proud jersey for your team?\u201d\n[Insert sound of gears grinding here]\nTribalism is inherently human, and we often fall into it unconsciously. For example, I recently watched a video clip from a NOVA [PBS] Special about tribalism which shared research from an MRI brain study and revealed this:\n\n\n\u201cIn one fMRI study, researchers divided subjects randomly into two teams and asked them about each other. Even though before the experiment they were all strangers, subjects were more positive about their teammates than rivals, and had distinct patterns of brain activity depending on whether they were asked about a teammate, or a foe; including in the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula. These regions respond to both rewards and threats in the environment, helping us differentiate between friend versus foe, telling us who to approach [our team] and who to avoid [the other team]. The same brain patterns appeared when subjects thought about political group identities of others.\u201d\n\n\u201cActing as a member of a group leads you to adopt different priorities and motivations. So can we ever overcome group identity to change someone\u2019s mind?\u201d [yes, via reason, rather than emotion or fear].\n\n\u201cWhenever participants were asked about opposing political opinions, many of them had increased activity in the amygdala \u2013 the part of their brain that processes emotion and fear. These individuals were less likely to change their minds.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, when you listen to the news, or watch political shows, or listen to political radio today, do you pick up on the narrative of fear and emotion?\n\nWhy is that? So that you will be more easily manipulated to think as they want you to think, and to activate your primal tribalism to demonize everyone who is not like you.\n\nPeople do it with politics, and with sports teams\u2026[that\u2019s partially where we learn this behavior at an early age, in school for example]\u2026.and they do it with their State, and their Nation, and yes, even their faith.\nTribalism, like Nationalism, is \u201cthe measles of the mind\u201d, as Albert Einstein once said.\n\nBut there is another way. Jesus proclaimed that \u201cGod so loved the World\u201d\u2026not just the Jews. Peter had to learn that God wanted to embrace the Gentiles, and that was a huge paradigm shift for him, and for other Jewish Christians at the time.\n\n\nPaul had to remind the Christians in Galatia that \u201cwe are all one in Christ Jesus\u201d and that in the Body of Christ we no longer recognize class [rich/poor], sexism [male/female], nationalism [jew/gentile], or any of those other man-made divisions.\n\n\nThe Gospel is for everyone. God loves everyone.\xa0No one is outside of our circle. No one is \u201cthem.\u201d We are all \u201cus.\u201d\nAll tribalism is childish, foolish, divisive and anti-Christ.\n\nJesus does not command you to love your nation. He commands you to love your neighbor, the poor, the outcast, and yes, even your enemy.\n\nAnd, may I suggest, even those who cheer for another sports team.\n\nLove is what unites us. Whenever we divide ourselves, this is not love. It is tribal, and it is anti-Christ.\n\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in the community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

75,Why John 3:16 Isn\u2019t About The Crucifixion,"November 6, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nIn preparation for an upcoming online debate about PSA [Penal Substitutionary Atonement] Theory, I started wondering whether or not Jesus, or any of the Gospel authors, specifically communicated the Gospel as being about Jesus dying on the cross for our sins, or to appease the wrath of God, etc.\n\xa0\nIn the process of exploring this question, I started with John 3:16 because, growing up, I had always equated it with the crucifixion. However, I realized that this entire conversation has nothing to do with the crucifixion, nor does it even mention the death of Jesus at all.\n\n\n\xa0\nHere\u2019s what the verse actually says:\n\xa0\n\u201cFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life.\u201d\n\xa0\nNow, I think most of the time we have been told to read the word \u201cgave\u201d in this sentence to mean that \u201cGod laid Jesus down on the cross as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of the world and sacrificed Him for us.\u201d\n\xa0\nBut, quite obviously, it does not say any such thing.\n\xa0\nWhat it says is that God loved the world. He loved the world so much that he gave us Jesus and that if anyone would trust in him, and his teachings, he would live and not die.\n\xa0\nI\u2019ve also started to realize that whenever Jesus talks about \u201ceternal life\u201d or \u201cwill not perish\u201d, he is not talking about the afterlife, or about what happens to us after we die.\n\xa0\nIn a very practical way, John 3:16 is a verse about how those who follow the path of Jesus will escape the coming destruction of Jerusalem and live beyond that event.\n\xa0\nHere\u2019s the deal: Jesus showed up as the promised Messiah at a time when the Jewish people were seeking a violent, revolutionary hero who would lead the uprising against their Roman oppressors. Instead, Jesus tells them to repent of this desire for violent revolution and warns them that if they live by the sword they will all die by the sword. He teaches them to love their enemies, turn the other cheek, walk the extra mile, and seek to overcome evil with good.\n\n\n\xa0\nThe promise, then, that Jesus makes is that they will have life that extends beyond the end of the age [that is, the end of the Jewish age], if they follow His teachings. If they refuse, then they will be slaughtered along with the destruction of the Temple, the end of the daily sacrifice, and the death of the Jewish Priesthood. [Which, by the way, is exactly what happened to those who rejected the message and path of Jesus].\n\xa0\nSo, the promise of John 3:16 is that those who trust in Jesus [that\u2019s what the word \u201cbelieve\u201d really means], and put his teachings into practice, will not reap the fruit of rebellion [which is death], but survive the end of the age which Jesus promises will come within a single generation.\n\xa0\nForty years later, that prediction came to pass.\n\xa0\nAnd, just as Jesus promised, those who followed the Way of Christ, escaped the \u201cwrath of God\u201d \u2013 which was simply the reaping of a harvest of rebellion against Rome \u2013 and the Christians who were in Jerusalem fled to the city of Peleg months before the Roman army surrounded the city and began to lay siege to it.\n\xa0\nIn this way, the promise of John 3:16 was fulfilled: Those who put their trust in the Way of Christ \u2013 which was to love their enemies, bless those who cursed them, and do good to those who hated them \u2013 escaped the horror of AD 70. They did not perish but inherited life beyond the end of the age [or \u201ceternal life\u201d that extended beyond the present age].\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\nJesus never communicated the Gospel as saying a prayer so you could go to heaven when you die, or as a human sacrifice that would appease the wrath of God. What Jesus said the Gospel was is simply this: \u201cChange your way of thinking! The Kingdom of God is here, right now! You can live under the rule and reign of God today. No need to wait until you\u2019re dead. The Good News is for your life now, not for after you die.\u201d [See\n\xa0\nHere are just a few examples from Scripture:\n\u201cI must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.\u201d (Luke 4:43)\n\u201cThe time has come,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news!\u201d (Mark 1:15)\n\u201cJesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.\u201d (Matt 9:35)\n\u201cJesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom..\u201d (Matt 4:23)",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/11/why-john-316-isnt-about-the-crucifixion/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
76,One Tribe: There Is Only Us,"November 2, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nImage: The Naked Pastor (Used by permission)\n\n\nTribalism is human nature. We tend to gather with those who are most like us. Whether that\u2019s people who love the same music, or the same sports team, or share the same values, or beliefs, or sense of humor.\n\n\n\nJesus understood this. He didn\u2019t tell us to stop being tribal. But, he did try to show us another way to think of who was in, our outside, of our tribe.\n\nWhen he told the Parable of the Good Samaritan, for example, Jesus re-framed the idea of neighbor, and brother, and showed us who we should love as we love ourselves: everyone we see.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s ok to be tribalistic, as long as you understand that there is only one tribe: The human tribe.\n\nWhen Jesus asks us to follow him, he is not asking us to form a tribe where only those who follow him are welcome or loved or included. This is where we get it wrong.\n\nNo, when Jesus asks us to follow him, he is asking us to simply follow his example, which was to love and embrace and accept and welcome everyone: The poor, the rich, the sick, the blind, the leper, the lame, the Samaritan, the young, the old, the outcast, the woman, the man, the eunuch, etc.\n\nIn other words: Follow Jesus because he is the leader of a tribe that welcomes everyone and shuns no one.\n\nBut, we cannot truly follow Jesus in this way as long as we continue to hold tight to our tribalism.\n\n\n\nFor example: Imagine there were 100 people in a room. \u201cWe are all one people,\u201d they might say. But then, over time, they start to divide into sub-groups by race, language, belief, etc. Now, if someone stands up and reminds them that they are all still one people, it is still true, but not as long as they continue to identify as members of that smaller tribe.\n\nThe only way they will truly ever realize that they are one people, is to renounce their allegiance to that sub-category and fully embrace their identity as members of the larger one.\n\nJesus wants us to understand that we are all one family.\n\n\u201c\u2026for you have only one Master and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth \u2018father,\u2019 for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.\u201d [Matt. 23:8-12]\n\nGod is our Father [Abba]. We are all children of God. This means we need to love one another as Christ loved us.\n\nSimply put, if we ever hope to love our neighbors, we have to be able to step outside of our tribe and see beyond our traditional group identity.\n\n\n\nIn the Body of Christ, there shouldn\u2019t be any tribes at all.\n\nThis is why Paul did not allow the believers in Corinth to line up behind Peter, or Apollos, or even himself, to create little factions or tribes within their church.\n\n\u201cMy brothers and sisters, some from Chloe\u2019s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you. What I mean is this: One of you says, \u201cI follow Paul\u201d; another, \u201cI follow Apollos\u201d; another, \u201cI follow Peter\u201d; still another, \u201cI follow Christ.\u201d Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?\u201d [1 Cor. 11-13]\n\nThe point Paul wants them to understand is quite simple: Don\u2019t align yourself with anyone but Christ. \n\nSo, if it was wrong for those Corinthian Christians to divide against one another over a preference of Apostle, how in the world would it be acceptable for Christians today to divide against one another over allegiances to this Political Party or the other? Or to divide over this Political Candidate or another one? Or to divide over doctrine? Or race?\n\n\n\nAnswer: It\u2019s not acceptable.\n\n\u201cIs Christ divided?\u201d Paul asks us. No, He is not.\n\nYet, today, Christians in America are especially divided over politics, and yes, over this Christian leader or that other one; over this doctrine or that denomination; and it ought not to be.\n\nNow, just imagine what might happen if you could honestly strip away every label and scrap of tribal identity? What if you were not a Baptist, but simply someone who loved Jesus? What if you weren\u2019t a Republican or a Democrat anymore, but simply a follower of Christ? What if you abandoned your identity as an American and saw yourself simply as a citizen in the Kingdom of God?\n\nThat is exactly what Paul wants us to grasp when he says:\n\n\u201cFor all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d [Gal. 3:27-28]\n\nCasting off our former identities is essential to unity. It\u2019s also essential to our mission, which is to love everyone \u2013 regardless of nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d you might say, \u201cisn\u2019t being a Christian just another tribe to join?\u201d\n\nAnswer: Not if you do it right.\n\nFor example, you can find your identity in Christ without resorting to tribalism. You can see yourself as a citizen of Christ\u2019s Kingdom without standing against another nation or kingdom, or religion.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Because being a member of the Body of Christ \u2013 by definition \u2013 is to be someone who does not use violence, or dominate others, or seek to put down other people, or take joy when others fail.\n\nRemember: Jesus told us to love our enemies. That means we don\u2019t hate them, we don\u2019t seek to dominate them, and we certainly don\u2019t kill them. (Would you kill someone you loved? Of course not.)\n\nWe must also remember that Jesus\u2019 greatest command was that we would love one another as He has loved us.\n\nBecause love is our highest command, we hold tight to these facts about love:\n\n\u201cLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\u201d [1 Cor. 13:4-7]\n\nSo, whenever you see people who claim to follow Christ standing up to boast, or to be unkind, or to dishonor someone from another tribe, or to read out loud a list of their sins and failures, then you\u2019re seeing someone who is still entangled in tribalism and still very, very far away from what it means to be \u201cin Christ\u201d and full of love for everyone.\n\nOnly someone who identifies as a Republican can mock a Democrat. Only someone who sees themselves as a Liberal can dishonor a Conservative. Only someone who considers themselves a Lutheran can scapegoat a Methodist. Only someone who believes they are an American can insult a Mexican.\n\nBut a Christian \u2013 a person who is filled with the agape love of Jesus and transformed by His indwelling presence \u2013 cannot do any of those things.\n\nTribalism separates us.\xa0Denominationalism\xa0divides us. Politics split us into opposing factions. But Christ came to\xa0bring us together. He has given to us the Ministry of\xa0Reconciliation\u2026which is about bringing everyone together, not dividing them into factions.\n\nIt\u2019s time to renounce our Tribalism.\n\nMy only identity is in Christ. The rest of me died when I took up my cross to follow Him.\n\nWhat about you?\n\n**\n\n\n\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

77,Blessed Are Those Who Are Born That Way,"October 31, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nWhen God established rules for who could \u2013 and who could not \u2013 enter into or serve within the Tabernacle, and later the Temple of God, He made a curious prohibition against those who were castrated, or who \u201chad their testicles crushed\u201d. [See Lev. 21:20]\nThese people are more commonly referred to in the Scriptures as \u201ceunuchs\u201d.\n\n\nLater, through the prophet Isaiah, God made these eunuchs a promise:\n\u201cLet not the eunuch say, \u201cBehold, I am a dry tree.\u201d For thus says the Lord: \u201cTo the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant, I will give in my house and within my walls a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.\u201d [Isaiah 56:3-7]\nGod\u2019s promise is to give these people, who were formerly outcast, a place of honor in God\u2019s House. However, it was never fulfilled under the Old Covenant.\nSo, was this promise left unfulfilled? Not at all.\nYou see, when Jesus is responding to the Pharisee\u2019s question regarding divorce, his disciples throw up their hands in exasperation after hearing Him say that a man may not divorce his wife other than for the sin of adultery. They exclaim, \u201cWhy even get married, then?\u201d To which Jesus replies:\n\u201cNot all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given. For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother\u2019s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.\u201d [Matthew 19:11-12]\n\n\nCuriously, Jesus seems to make a statement that he realizes will be difficult for His disciples to wrap their minds around. \u201cTuck this one in your back pocket for now,\u201d he seems to say. \u201cThis won\u2019t make any sense to you now, but later on this concept will become more clear.\u201d\nSo, what is a eunuch? Is it simply someone who has no interest in the opposite sex? Or in marriage? Is it someone who has no functional genitalia [as in Lev.21:20]? And, what is the difference between a eunuch who is \u201cborn that way\u201d and those who are \u201cmade eunuchs by men\u201d and \u201cthose who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom\u201d?\nJesus bookends this statement with the warning: \u201cNot all men can accept this. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.\u201d\nWhatever a eunuch might be, we see that Jesus is referencing the earlier promise made by Isaiah. Jesus honors those who are eunuchs \u2013 whether because they were born that way, made that way, or for the sake of the Kingdom of God. In the context of his dialog with the Pharisees and the Disciples, Jesus seems to place the emphasis on those eunuchs who choose not to marry \u2013 not to participate in the normative practices of the culture \u2013 but who instead devote themselves totally to the Gospel and the Kingdom of God.\n\n\nKeep in mind that, in Jewish culture, a woman had no value apart from child-birth. A man without male children was a disgrace and most likely cursed by God. Even the \u201cChosen\u201d status of the Children of Israel was tied to giving birth to the eventual Messiah. How could anyone choose to disengage from that most natural and holy endeavors as being married and having children in a culture like this?\nAs we\u2019ve already noted, that promise in Isaiah to eunuchs being granted a \u201cmonument and a name better than sons and daughters\u201d was never fulfilled in the Old Covenant \u201cHouse of God\u201d, but it was certainly fulfilled in the New Covenant \u201cHouse of God\u201d, which is the ekklesia, or Body of Christ.\nWho was the first non-Jewish convert baptized into the new Temple of God? A eunuch from Ethiopa. [See Acts 8:27]\nWhen the evangelist Philip met this man he was reading from Isaiah 53:7-8. Imagine this eunuch\u2019s surprise after his baptism when he, no doubt, continued on reading in the scroll and discovered the promise of God to him \u2013 and to every other eunuch \u2013 a few chapters later in Isaiah 56:3-7.\nWho else has made themselves a eunuch for the Kingdom of God?\n\n\nWell, Jesus, for one. He abandoned his identity as a potential husband or a father, in the natural sense, to embrace the title of Bridegroom for a people who would become his Bride through faith in Him. His only \u201cBride\u201d or wife is us, the Church.\nPaul was also a \u201ceunuch for the Kingdom\u201d who remained celibate for the sake of the Gospel, and urged others to do the same:\n\u201cTo the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am. . . But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and his interests are divided. The woman who is unmarried\u2026is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband. This I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.\u201d [1 Corinthians 7:8, 32-33]\nWhat of those who embrace their natural identity and who become fathers and mothers, or husbands and wives? Those labels will vanish and fade away in the age to come:\n\n\n\u201cFor in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.\u201d \u2013 Jesus [Matt. 22:30]\nBut for those who do embrace this calling to become eunuchs for the Kingdom, there is a promise that is eternal and that will never be taken away.\nJesus gives us three categories of eunuchs: Those who were \u201cborn that way\u201d, those who \u201cwere made that way by men\u201d and those who \u201care eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom\u201d.\nEunuchs who are \u201cmade that way by men\u201d are undoubtedly those who were castrated. This tells us that the Ethiopian eunuch, and the eunuch who lived and served in the Temple [see 2 Kings 23:11] were both \u201cborn that way from their mother\u2019s womb\u201d.\xa0 How do we know this? Because if they had been \u201cmade that way by men\u201d [i.e. \u201ccastrated\u201d] then they wouldn\u2019t have been admitted into the Temple, according to the prohibition commanded in Leviticus 21:20.\nSo, what does it mean to be someone who is a eunuch \u201cfrom their mother\u2019s womb\u201d? Many believe that this would be a reference to what we would call someone with a same-sex attraction. Why? Because these people did not exhibit what would have been seen as a \u201cnormative\u201d sexual orientation.\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, they were men without passion for women, and/or women without interest in taking a husband and bearing children \u2013 as most women would be expected to do. At a minimum, these enuchs are \u201cnon-heterosexuals\u201d who do not have any interest in fulfilling their culturally-accepted gender roles.\nThe third category that Jesus mentions is someone for whom the expected sexual norms and usual gender roles do not apply. Furthermore, it is someone who has embraced a new identity in Christ to become a eunuch for the Kingdom, by choice.\nThis is what Jesus did. It\u2019s what Paul the Apostle did and urged others to do, \u201cif they can receive it.\u201d\nWhat greater calling can there be than to become, like Jesus our Lord and the Apostle Paul, one of the eunuch\u2019s for the sake of the Kingdom of God?\nNote: I say this only to remove dishonor from those who have willingly chosen such a life, or who have been born this way. This is not an attempt to recruit people into a life of celibacy, nor away from \u2013 or towards \u2013 any sort of lifestyle.\nGranted, not everyone is \u201cborn this way\u201d and few of us are \u201cmade this way by men\u201d, but there are several who do not value traditional marriage as much as others do. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Christians for whom the traditional role of husband or wife, or mother or father, is not an option. Whether by sexual attraction or by lack of opportunity, these men and women are on the outside of the cultural norms and sexual identities that our society has imposed upon them. Many of them are ok with this identity. Others wish they could change their condition. But, my point is, that they need not feel condemnation from God regarding their condition.\n\n\nSo, rather than endure the shame that is often tied to this classification, these dear people are among an elite tribe of human beings who have been given a promise, and a monument, and an everlasting name that will be, in the House of God, one of honor and of high esteem. Our Lord Himself has identified with them and stands beside them as one who is on the outside of normative cultural expectations for gender and sexuality and identity.\nNow, I also know that many who are Gay and Christian who want nothing more than to find another person to share their life with. This is a common, human desire. My hope is to share another possibility that they might consider embracing \u2013 a promise from God to step into a place of exceptional service for their Lord and King. However, this is only one option, not the only option.\nAs much as we might not want to believe it, celibacy is not a death sentence. For many in the Kingdom of God, it is a high calling and a position of great honor. But, celibacy need not become a dead-end option either. If God does not condemn those who are outside of the cultural norms of gender and sexuality, why should we?\nIs there anyone, today, who has abandoned their normative cultural \u2013 and natural \u2013 identity as a husband or a wife? If so, they may now embrace the example of Jesus and of Paul the Apostle who served as \u201ceunuchs for the Kingdom\u201d and experienced the promise of God through the prophet Isaiah to receive a \u201ca monument and a name better than sons and daughters\u201d and \u201can everlasting name that will not be cut off.\u201d\n\n\nIs there anyone who has been born different than others around them; with a sexuality that doesn\u2019t seem to conform to commonly-accepted norms? Then find yourself deep in the arms of blessing from your Abba, Father who draws you close and whispers:\n\u201cI will give to you, in my house and within my walls, a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give you an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.\u201d\nLet those who can receive it, receive it.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

78,Stop Waiting For Jesus To Return To Fix Everything,"October 30, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nChristians, we have a huge problem. Instead of following the teachings of Jesus, we\u2019re mostly waiting around for Jesus to come back and fix everything.\n\nFor example, we live in a violent world. War, genocide, murder, hate crimes, mass shootings, and riots are commonplace in our world. Instead of seeing this as proof that we have more work to do, we tend to throw our hands in the air and say something like, \u201cthis is just the way things are\u201d and \u201cnone of this will change until Jesus comes back.\u201d\n\n\nNot only is this a failure to follow the teachings of Jesus, it\u2019s flat out wrong.\nSee, according to the scriptures, the Messiah who was to come would teach us to walk in a new path. This new path would eventually lead his followers to do two things: One, to beat their swords into plowshares and Two, to study war no more.\nBut, instead of doing this, we point to Jesus and accuse Him of not fixing our violence problem the first time and now we\u2019re waiting for him to come back the second time to make all things new.\nHonestly, most Christians who believe this way actually do NOT think that Jesus will return to bring peace to the world that second time. What they believe is that Jesus will return riding a war stallion and brandishing a sword [out of his mouth] to slaughter his enemies in a robe dipped in blood.\nWhat they misunderstand is that this violent end times imagery is allegorical [first of all], and that the blood covering Jesus is his own blood, and that the sword in his mouth isn\u2019t a real metal sword of violence but a figurative, metaphorical sword of the Gospel of peace which transforms enemies into friends and responds to everyone with love\u2026which is why the sword isn\u2019t in his hand but comes out of his mouth, like the Gospel message of mercy, forgiveness and grace.\n\n\nHere\u2019s the real problem with saying that the peace we need here on earth is supposed to come after Jesus comes back again: The scriptures never teach this.\nWhat we see is that, as in Isaiah 2:2-5, that Messiah comes [the first time] and that people from all nations [every tongue and tribe] come to him and say, \u201cHe [Jesus] will teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths.\u201d [v3] and what is the result of walking in the path of Jesus? Simply this:\n\u201cThey will beat their swords into plowshares\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and their spears into pruning hooks.\nNation will not take up sword against nation,\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0nor will they train for war anymore.\nCome, descendants of Jacob,\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0let us walk in the light\xa0of the\xa0Lord.\u201d [v.4-5]\nSo, if we refuse to walk in the path of Jesus and if we refuse to listen to his teaching and his ways \u2013 which were about nonviolent, others-centered love \u2013 then we don\u2019t get to lay the blame for this on Jesus.\nIf anything, it is Jesus who turns to us and says: \u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord, lord\u2019 and not do what I say?\u201d\nThe fact that we don\u2019t see anyone beating their swords into plowshares or their spears into pruning hooks is because \u2013 wait for it \u2013 because WE have not been willing to turn our weapons into gardening tools.\n\n\nThe fact that we don\u2019t see nations refusing to take up sword against other nations is simply because \u2013 for the most part \u2013 Christians of every nation for the last 1,600 years have been all-too-willing to take up arms against others to defend the honor and interest of their birth-nation.\nLet\u2019s put it this way: If every follower of Christ refused to fight in wars, there would be no more war. Or, if nothing else, it would be much harder to fight a war without the willing participation of people who claim to follow Christ.\nSadly, Christians have largely proven that they are more willing to lay down their life for their country than they are to lay down their lives for Christ.\nSee, while we\u2019ve been sitting around waiting for Christ to return, the rest of Creation has been waiting for us. Or, as Paul puts it:\n\n\n\u201cFor the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.\xa0For the creation was subjected to frustration\u2026in hope\xa0\xa0that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.\u201d [Romans 8:19-21]\n\n\nIn other words: It\u2019s time to stop waiting and it\u2019s time to start living the life that Jesus came to give us so abundantly. We are the people we have been waiting for. Jesus showed us the way, now it\u2019s time to walk in it.\nSo, friends, if you claim to be in Christ, you must walk [and live] as Jesus did. [See 1 John 2:6]\nThis means taking his words and putting them into practice. It means listening to his teachings and walking in his path and learning his ways.\nIf we do this, then we ourselves will begin to refuse violence and to embrace our enemies and to abandon our weapons of warfare \u2013 because we know that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against spiritual authorities and powers that can only be overcome by the irresistible power of love.\nWhen do we start this? Right now.\nWhen do we refuse to study war? Today.\nWhen do we start using our weapons for garden rakes? As soon as possible.\nJesus has already shown us the path. Now, we simply have to walk in it, one day at a time.\nAre you ready?\nLet\u2019s walk.\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

79,Action Figures,"October 26, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nNearly every Saturday morning I used to drive my two teenage boys up to a collectibles warehouse in Diamond Bar, California for the morning. It\u2019s one of the main things the three of us loved to do together on a regular basis, and I loved spending that time with them as often as possible.\nOne weekend, as we drove underneath an overpass my oldest son pointed out a hand-drawn sign that someone had fastened to the outside of the rail. It read \u201cJesus Saves From Hell.\u201d\n\n\nWhat followed was a fascinating discussion about Christianity in America today.\nOne of my sons compared that message to something like \u201cBuddha Leads To Nirvana\u201d because most of the people in his generation today aren\u2019t really sitting around thinking about things like Hell, or Being Saved.\nWe talked about how the Church today seems to be stuck on a script from the 1970\u2019s that almost no one in our modern society is actually reading from.\nThat sign brought responses from my boys like, \u201cWhy is it always about hell?\u201d, \u201cIs getting saved from hell all we need Jesus for?\u201d, \u201cEven if Jesus does save from hell, what does that sign want me to do about it?\u201d, etc.\nFrom there our conversation went into another interesting direction. We started talking about the difference between promoting Christianity via a series of messages versus the idea of promoting Jesus\u2019 way of life by the way we actually loved people, cared for the poor, served others, and became living examples of the kind of life that Jesus can offer us.\nOne of my son\u2019s said, \u201cIf Christians were known for being people who took care of the poor, or who helped people in need, then even if non-christians disagreed with our faith they at least could respect the fact that we lived what we say we believe.\u201d\n\n\nThis is why it\u2019s so important that those of us who do understand this way of thinking go out of our way to demonstrate the love of Jesus to those around us. Because most Christians around us are not primarily focused on loving others. Most Christians in our society seem to be more concerned with being right and with proving that everyone else\xa0is wrong.\nOf course, this sort of conversation is an easy thing to have in a moving vehicle on a Saturday morning on your way to shop for vintage video games and action figures and old comic books. But at least having these sorts of conversations means that there\u2019s the possiblity that these very practical ideas about loving and serving and sharing and giving can actually spill out into our every day lives.\nI get it. No one really lives this out in any perfect way. But the fact that we cannot live it out perfectly should not prevent us from living it out at all.\nThe world around us is desperate to see the real evidence of a living Christ. We are ambassadors of His love. We are His hands and His feet. If we, those who are called by His Name, are not willing and able and empowered to love as He loved, and to give as He gave, and to serve as He served, then who is?\n\n\n\n\nI am reminded of a little verse that says, \u201cIf anyone claims to be in Him, he must walk as Jesus did.\u201d (1 John 2:6)\nBeing a Christian is about so much more than slogans. It\u2019s about putting our faith into practice and stepping out daily to allow Jesus to live and breathe in us so that the world around us might experience the transformational love of God.\nBreathe deep.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

80,Why Undocumented Immigrants Are A Blessing From God,"October 24, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nIn spite of how often we hear that immigrants are a drain on our economy and we need to build a fence after we deport all of them, the truth is quite the opposite. According to the Wall Street Journal, which recently surveyed 46 economists, immigration has been very good for the U.S. economy.\xa0\n\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\u201cImmigrants fill in the gaps of our labor market, at both the high and low ends of the skill spectrum.\u201d In other words, \u201cAmerica\u2019s educational system does not produce enough scientists and engineers to meet the needs of a growing technology sector, this means that some of the brightest minds from across the world come to the U.S. (usually lawfully). But there are also major gaps in low-skill jobs, [those which don\u2019t require a college degree, or even a high school degree].\u201d\nAccording to the article: \u201cvery few Americans are content to endure the long hours required of agricultural work, for example, which is why 50% to 60% of the food that touches our table was touched by immigrant hands along the way. Because immigrants are willing to do this hard work\u2026we all enjoy inexpensive produce. The same logic applies to many other sectors of our economy, and we all benefit.\u201d\nUndocumented workers are also consumers and, as such, they stimulate our economy. They are also more likely to start their own businesses, at a rate that\u2019s nearly twice that of native-born Americans. [Does that make them \u201cjob creators\u201d?]\nIn spite of what you\u2019ve been told, undocumented immigrants also pay taxes. The Social Security Administration estimates that three out of four undocumented immigrants has payroll taxes deducted from their paycheck and also pays income, Medicare, and Social Security taxes. And while many of these are using false Social Security numbers, the Social Security Administration admits that they took in $12 billion in 2007 from names that did not match the right numbers.\n\n\nThis means we know full well that undocumented workers pay taxes and contribute to the Social Security pie, and not only do we try to deny it, we are also perfectly happy to let it continue.\nSo, millions of undocumented immigrants are paying into a government program that they will never receive benefits from because their bogus number is not valid for receiving benefits, [only for paying in].\nTherefore, these people are indirectly responsible for subsidizing our broken and unsustainable Social Security system for the rest of us.\nCould the Government make a Social Security card that was more difficult to counterfeit? Obviously they already do so with other US documents like passports and Federal ID cards which utilize a photo, fingerprints, and barcodes to verify the person\u2019s identity. Perhaps they lack the proper incentive to change the decades-old design of the Social Security card which anyone with a sheet of blue construction paper and a typewriter could counterfeit in under an hour?\nSimilarly, the IRS allows undocumented immigrants to file their taxes using a special \u201cIndividual Taxpayer Identification Number\u201d, while assuring them that they will not share their illegal status with the Border Patrol or the State Department. This means that many of them do file income tax, even though they are not eligible for most of the public benefits that their taxes make possible, such as: welfare checks, food stamps, federal subsidized housing, Supplementary Security Income, and other cash benefits.\n\n\nYes, immigrants are allowed to receive a free public education (guaranteed by the Supreme Court) and for emergency room treatments, but those costs are mainly incurred by local and state governments. \xa0So, at the State and Local level, the average immigrant DOES cost more in services than they pay in taxes. But at the Federal level, the reverse is true.\nPerhaps this is why the federal government seems so slow to enact reforms? They are the only level of government capable of enforcing any change to the current system, and they are reaping all the benefits of it. State and local governments are more motivated to change things, because they\u2019re upside down on the deal, but they have zero power to change the status quo.\nThe end result? The American people are still receiving the better end of the deal. The average immigrant will pay in $80,000 more over the course of a lifetime than they will ever take out in services across the board.\nThat means that undocumented immigrants are a positive blessing from God to our Nation. Maybe it\u2019s time we started treating them that way?\nNow, in the past whenever I\u2019ve shared ideas like this one, I\u2019ve received more than a little push-back from Christians who wonder if I\u2019m in favor of illegal immigration. Like this guy who said:\n\n\n\u201cI am curious to hear your defense of someone illegally entering a foreign nation, and following that up with repeatedly violating multiple other laws of that nation while simultaneously illegally receiving a variety of monetary benefits\u2026Surely you aren\u2019t going to argue that the mere \u201cexistence\u201d of immigration laws represents an \u201cunjust law\u201d that \u2013 as a believer \u2013 can be morally ignored? I\u2019m just trying to establish a \u2018baseline\u2019 for your argument, here. Where does \u2018just enforcement\u2019 begin, in your view? Or is there no such thing?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a fair question and one that that I myself have wrestled with over the years as someone who has tried to reconcile my faith with everything else in my life.\nIn the past, I might have tried to do exactly what he asked me to do: Justify the legality of immigration laws in our country, or seek to directly balance the words of Jesus with American immigration policy.\nBut that\u2019s not what I do anymore. I have a different perspective now.\nHere\u2019s how I answered my friend:\n\u201cDo I need to justify prostitution to care for a prostitute? Is it \u2018anti-criminal justice\u2019 to serve in prison ministry? Am I pro-drug use if I serve someone who is addicted to drugs?\n\n\u201cNo. We show mercy and grace and the love of Jesus to everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSee, we don\u2019t need to limit our ministry to those who are \u201crighteous\u201d and \u201claw-abiding\u201d. In fact, to do so would be completely pointless.\nThe point is: We all need transformation.\nAnd Jesus was quick to point out that it was only those who were sick who need a physician, and it\u2019s only those who admit they are blind that receive healing for their blindness.\nThe greatest blindness, of course, is not recognizing our own blind spots. If we fail to see ourselves in the outcast, and the poor, and the broken, then we also fail to see Jesus in them as well.\n\u201cWhatever you have done for the least of these, you have done it unto me,\u201d Jesus reminds us.\nSo, we really only love Jesus as much as we love the people around us who are poor, and weak, and hungry, and thirsty, and naked and in prison.\nWhat\u2019s more, we are reminded in the New Testament that we ourselves are equally in need of Jesus and His mercy and grace and healing as anyone \u2013 and everyone \u2013 else we see:\n\u201cOr do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God?\u2026.And that is what some of you were.\u201d [1 Cor. 6:9-11]\n\n\nWe forget that we are no better than anyone else. We are all sinners saved by the same grace. We are all people who are dearly loved of God and in need of His endless mercy.\nRefugees and illegal immigrants are people, just like you and me. They love their families. They want to live in peace. They are running from war and oppression and poverty and looking to find a new life here \u2013 just the way we would if it was our family \u2013 our children \u2013 who were starving and dying and in need of safety.\n\nRegardless of what the laws might say, we are answerable to a higher authority. Jesus, our glorious eternal King, commands us to treat everyone \u2013 especially the weakest among us \u2013 as if they were Him.\xa0\n\nIt\u2019s not our job to work out who is most deserving of His mercy. That\u2019s way above our pay grade. Our job is to love everyone we see and to recognize that our King commands us to be extravagant with our love.\xa0\n\nSo, do I support illegal immigration? No, I don\u2019t. But I do support loving everyone around me. If those people happen to be illegal immigrants, or refugees, or Muslims, or anything else, my job is to love them as much as I love Jesus.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re following Jesus, it\u2019s your job too.\n**\nRead more:\nWSJ ARTICLE HERE\nMore info:\nSpecial thanks to \u201cUndocumented.tv\u201d for their original research and commentary.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

81,Labyrinth Heart,"October 24, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nMy wife and I recently celebrated our 29th wedding anniversary. On the card she made for me was a heart-shaped labyrinth and on the inside she wrote:\n\u201cI found out that labyrinth\u2019s aren\u2019t supposed to be difficult or confusing, but simply about the journey to the center. This spoke to me as far as our relationship together and with God. We are travelling to the center, or the heart, and that alone is a blessing. What a sweet gift to walk this journey with you.\u201d\n\n\nThat little idea has stayed with me over the last few days. It\u2019s reminded me that the secret of life is enjoying the passage of time. The point of the path is to walk it, not to necessarily arrive somewhere, but to really appreciate the walk itself.\nToo often we forget that the things that bring us joy are already here. Life is wonderful simply because it is life. As my Dad often reminds me, \u201cGetting old may be painful, but it beats the alternative.\u201d\nI was also reminded of a quote by Watchman Nee which says: \u201cMost Christians spend all of their lives trying to get into a room they are already in.\u201d\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what he meant by that, but to me, it speaks to our desire to make God proud, or to please Him, or to prove to God that we are true believers, or whatever. But God already loves us more than we can hope or dream or imagine. There\u2019s no way to make God love us more, or less. God\u2019s love is always on; full-blast, 24/7.\nOne of my favorite verses in the Bible is 1 John 3:1 which says:\n\u201cSee\xa0what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!\u201d\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\nI think I love this for two reasons: First, because it uses the word \u201clavished\u201d to describe how God has loved us. I love that image of God just sloshing out the love to us and spilling it everywhere, overflowing our cup, and dripping it all over the table.\nSecondly, I love this verse because it affirms that God is our Father and that we are God\u2019s children. Then it re-emphasizes it once more: \u201cAnd that is what we are!\u201d [with the exclamation mark appearing twice for added impact].\nWe are God\u2019s children. God\u2019s love for us is unimaginably huge, and awesome, and grand, and overflowing, and extravagant, and audacious, and radically inclusive. We cannot ever escape the love of God. Nothing can take it away. Nothing can slow it down. Nothing can come against God\u2019s love. God\u2019s love never fails.\nSo, as you walk this daily path of life, try to remember that you\u2019re already in the room you\u2019re trying so hard to break into. God already loves and accepts you more than you know.\nTry, also, to remember that the point of this path is to enjoy the journey, and to appreciate the people in your life you get to share it all with.\n\n\nThe great news is: You and I will only ever know what its\u2019 like to draw nearer to God. From this moment and onward into eternity, we will only ever experience more of Christ \u2013 not less. Because God lives within us. God promises never to leave or forsake us. God has declared that nothing will ever separate us from this love. We are being drawn nearer and nearer \u2013 deeper and deeper \u2013 into communion with God.\n\n\nThere is not end to the labyrinth of God\u2019s heart. It continues on forever and forever. This is why we need an eternity to know God more.\nSo, sit back and enjoy the journey. It\u2019s going to be a long one, but I promise it will never be boring.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

82,Is Crucifixion Necessary For Us To Enter the Kingdom?,"October 19, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nIn preparation for an upcoming debate about the doctrine of Penal Substitutionary Atonement, my adversary asked me if it was necessary for Jesus to die before we could enter the Kingdom of God.\nThis is a great question!\nFirst of all, let\u2019s establish what the Gospel is, and then we can answer that question.\n\n\nThe Gospel \u2013 the \u201cGood News\u201d \u2013 that Jesus came to proclaim was simply this:\n\u201cRepent! The Kingdom of God is at hand.\u201d\nWe find Jesus preaching this Gospel of the Kingdom of God all the time. This Gospel is found in the 4 Gospels in the New Testament \u2013 Matthew, Mark, Luke and John:\n\u201cI must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.\u201d (Luke 4:43)\n\u201cThe time has come,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!\u201d (Mark 1:15)\n\u201cJesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.\u201d (Matt 9:35)\n\u201cJesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom..\u201d (Matt 4:23)",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/10/is-crucifixion-necessary-for-us-to-enter-the-kingdom/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
83,Concentric Circles of Love,"October 18, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nWe talk a lot in the house church movement about \u201cBeing the Church\u201d versus \u201cGoing to Church\u201d but what does that really mean? What does it look like in practical terms to \u201cbe the Church\u201d?\n\nI can only speak for myself and share what we\u2019ve experienced in our own house church family regardign this idea. A few years ago, when my wife Wendy and I started a house church out of our home called \u201cThe Mission,\u201d part of our rationale for that name was to serve as a reminder to all of us that, as followers of Christ, we are all missionaries. This means that we all have a mission field. Yours may look different from mine, but being a follower of Christ means living out our own individual mission or calling.\n\n\nFor some of us our mission field might be our Fifth grade class that we teach every day. For others it may be the homeless in our community. For still another it might be a handful of young people we\u2019re taking the time to tutor after school, or it may simply be our neighbors across street.\nThe important thing is to realize that we have a mission and to help encourage one another to live out our calling to have an impact for Christ in that mission field.\nOne illustration that we\u2019ve developed to help us understand how to live this out in our daily lives is something called \u201cConcentric Circles of Love\u201d. Here\u2019s how it works:\nJesus told us that the greatest commandment is to love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength. He said the second greatest command \u201cis like the first\u201d \u2013 to love our neighbor as ourselves.\nWhat did he mean, \u201cthe second (loving others) is like the first?\u201d I think the New Testament is pretty clear that how we love God is reflected in the way we treat others.\n\u201cIf anyone says, \u201cI love God,\u201d and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.\u201d(1 John 4:20-21)\n\n\n\u201cAnd the King will answer them, \u2018Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.\u2019\u201d \u2013 Matt 25:40\nSo, the way we love others reflects our love for God, and vice versa. This is where the concentric circles come in.\nIf we ever really hope to obey Jesus in this area of loving God and loving others we have to start with loving God. Why? Because the love we need to share with others isn\u2019t our own brand of love. It\u2019s the \u201cagape\u201d love of God that isn\u2019t selfish or arrogant. That kind of love isn\u2019t in us by nature. We can only receive it from God.\nSo, at the center of our circle we need to spend time learning how to love God. But that\u2019s only the beginning. The next circle is our immediate family; our spouse, our children, our parents, our brothers and sisters. If we can\u2019t love those people with the love of Christ we have no hope of loving total strangers.\nThe next circle is the Church family. I believe that Jesus commanded us to love one another because He knew how hard this would really be. Love isn\u2019t easy. Especially if we follow Jesus and love others sacrificially \u2013 putting their needs ahead of our own.\n\n\n\n\nNext we need to practice loving our neighbors, our co-workers \u2013 the people God has put us in community with on a regular basis. This is our mission field. We need to cultivate the love we receive from God in the inner circle, share that love with our family and church, and allow it to drive us (or \u201ccompel us\u201d) to serve our co-workers and neighbors in Jesus\u2019 name.\nOn the outside circles we need to share the love of Christ with the poor, the homeless, the outcast and the lost. And, our ultimate goal is to bring those on the outer circles deeper inside the circle. This means we want the outcast and the stranger to be welcomed into the community of faith, into the warmth of our homes, and into the love of Christ.\nBeyond learning how to love God and love others we also need to practice receiving the love of God and receiving love from others. Love is not a one way street.\nI think this can be one of the most challenging aspects of \u201cbeing church\u201d together. Washing the feet of another person is always easier than being the one who is having their feet washed. It involves humility and transparency.\nKeep in mind that all of us should happen holistically. It\u2019s not a \u201cstep one, step two\u201d process. In other words, if we wait until we get really good at the first or the second circle, we\u2019ll never move on to the other circles.\n\n\nThe truth is, we\u2019re all constantly learning how to love God and love others in our lives at the same time. The important thing is not to neglect one over the other, and to always remember that everything flows from that center circle who is our Lord, Jesus Christ.\nThis illustration is only part of what it means to \u201cBe the Church\u201d but it\u2019s a great place to start.\nWATCH: Concentric Circles of Love by Keith Giles\n\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d with a Foreword by Greg Boyd.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

84,The Childlikeness of God,"October 16, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\u201cAnd he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken the child in his arms, he said, \u201cWhoever receives a child like this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not only me, but also the Father who sent me.\u201d [Mark 9:33-37]\nSuch a simple, yet profound illustration here by Jesus. I fear it is often overlooked for its simplicity, sadly. So, I\u2019d like to take a moment to examine it a bit closer.\n\n\nThis object lesson comes immediately after Jesus realizes that the disciples had been arguing with one another about which of them was the greatest. Not their finest moment. But, in response, Jesus takes a small child and holds her in his arms and after telling them that the greatest in the Kingdom is the servant, or slave, of all, he then makes this astounding statement: To receive a child is to receive Christ, and to receive Christ is to also receive the Father.\nThe late, great theologian George MacDonald deduced from this the following:\n\u201cThen to receive a child in the name of Jesus is to receive Jesus; to receive Jesus is to receive God; therefore, to receive the child is to receive God.\u201d\n\xa0\u201cWhat is the Kingdom of Christ? A rule of love, of truth \u2013 a rule of service. The King is the chief servant in it\u2026.If then, to enter this Kingdom, we must become children, the spirit of children must be its pervading spirit throughout, from lowly subject to lowliest King\u2026.\u2019Whosoever shall humble himself as a little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\xa0\u201c\u2026To receive the child because God receives it\u2026is one thing; to receive it because it is like God\u2026is another.\n\xa0\u201c\u2026But to advance now to the highest point of this teaching of our Lord: \u2018He that receives me receives Him who sent me.\u201d To receive a child in the name of God is to receive God himself\u2026\n\xa0\u201c\u2026God is represented in Jesus, for that God is like Jesus: Jesus is represented in the child, for that Jesus is like the child. Therefore, God is represented in the child, for that he is like the child. God is child-like.\u201d\n\u2013 [Unpoken Sermons, George MacDonald, pgs. 10-12]\nAre we so scandalized by this notion that God is child-like? If so, why?\nIs it because we still prefer a God who is too Holy to be near us? Do we have trouble imagining a God who is closer to us than our own heartbeat? Or as near to us as our own breath?\nJesus is \u201cGod with us\u201d or \u201cEmmanuel\u201d. He promised never to leave us \u2013 ever. He is here now and so is the Father. Together, they both have come to make their home in us.\n\n\nThis means that Jesus and the Father and the Holy Spirit are living and breathing in me \u2013 and in you \u2013 right now.\nGod is not far away. God is not \u201cout there\u201d or \u201cup there\u201d. God is not high and exalted in the sense that God is not right here, right now; inhabiting this very moment.\nThis means that every moment is a Holy Moment. All ground is Holy Ground. All experiences are Spiritual experiences.\n\n\nAnd, more than this, it means that God is humble and loving, and giving, and yes, even childlike.\nSay it out loud: God is childlike.\nAs MacDonald sums it up:\n\u201cHow terribly, then, have the theologians misrepresented God in the measures of the low and showy, not the lofty and simple humanities!\xa0 Nearly all of them represent him as a great King on a grand throne, thinking how grand he is, and making it the business of his being and the end of the universe to keep up his glory, wielding the bolts of Jupiter [or Zeus] against them that take his name in vain\u2026.Brothers, have you found our King? There he is, kissing little children and saying they are like God\u2026the simplest peasant who loves his children and his sheep were \u2013 no, not a truer, for the is false, but \u2013 a true type of our God beside that monstrosity of a monarch.\u201d\n\n\nTo be like God, then, is to be like a child: Full of innocence, wonder, humility, playfulness, and generosity.\nThe essential essence of mankind is childhood. Every adult is just an overgrown child who has forgotten their childlikeness. Jesus wants us to remember who we were \u2013 who we really are. And when we do, we realize that God is also childlike and we are like God when we are like the inner child who remains hidden within us.\nNow, this doesn\u2019t mean that God is \u201cchildish\u201d \u2013 those are two different things, aren\u2019t they? God is not childish, and we are not encouraged to be childish \u2013 impatient, impudent, stubborn, willful, demanding, etc.\nWe ARE encouraged to become like little children in order to see the Kingdom, enter the Kingdom, and receive Christ \u2013 and therefore the Father also.\nTry to imagine God as a childlike being who is kind, gentle, humble, loving, compassionate, generous and accepting. This is what it means to see God as God truly is. It\u2019s also what it means to see a picture of we are also called to be as image-bearers of the Divine.\n\n\nI am encouraged by this upside-down view of God as a childlike soul who holds the universe in his hands, and yet does so without any guile, or malice, or anger, or wrath.\nThis is the picture of God we see embodied in Christ. This is who God is, and this is who we are called to become.\nThis is how we descend into the greatness described by Jesus where the greatest is the servant, the most humble, of all.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

85,Why I Hate Going To Church,"October 13, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Kenn Stilger, Heavnly Photos\nIt would be very easy to post a very long list of reasons why I hate going to church, but the main reason is that \u201cgoing to Church\u201d is a sad excuse for \u201cbeing the Church\u201d and those who follow Christ are called to be the Church, not to attend one.In other words, \u201cgoing to Church\u201d involves having a meeting\xa0about\xa0Jesus. Whereas \u201cbeing the Church\u201d involves meeting\xa0with\xa0Jesus and allowing Him to do the speaking, the teaching, the leading and the directing.\xa0Going to Church is about assigning people specific functions, and often involves compensating them financially to do so, while the majority of people sit and observe them.\n\n\nBeing the Church involves every single person using the gifts that God has provided them with to serve one another, where no one person is considered greater or smarter or more spiritual than anyone else. In fact, we\u2019re all equally miserable apart from Christ, so our desire to meet with Him and to hear from Him is magnified because we understand that without Him leading us, and teaching us, and speaking to us, we are completely hopeless.\n\xa0\nJesus did not die for an organization or a business model. Jesus died for a people (ekklesia) that He could call His own. He wants relationship. He wants love. He wants to be known.\n\n\nMost of us can relate to that.\nGod made us with the ability to know Him, and even placed a craving within us to seek Him out.\nHe is not far away. He wants us to find Him.\nThis is exactly what\xa0the New Covenant was all about\xa0\u2013 \u201cI will be their God and they will be my people.\u201d [Hebrews 8:10]\nWhat people need most today is not religion. They do not need another Church. They need connection. They need to meet the God who would rather die than live without them.\n\n\nForget going to Church. Go to Jesus. Be the Church. Embrace your identity as the Bride that Jesus died to redeem.\nLearn to hear His voice. He wants to speak to you. He wants you to experience the kind of life you could only dream about. That life is found only through knowing Jesus.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

86,"No, Jesus Was Not Separated From The Father On The Cross","October 12, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nOn the cross, Jesus cried out, \u201cMy God, my God! Why have you forsaken me?\u201d\nFrom this single sentence, many bible teachers and pastors have theorized that it was in this moment that the Father looked away from Jesus \u2013 because of all of our sins being laid upon Jesus \u2013 and it was in this moment that Jesus experienced separation from the Father for the only time in all of eternity.\n\n\nAs dramatic and poetically compelling that might be, the truth is simply this: The Bible nowhere supports this theory.\nSo, where does it come from?\nWell, apparently the teaching that the Father actually did forsake Jesus on the cross, and that Jesus experienced separation from the Father comes from a few assumptions:\nFirst, the assumption that God is too holy to look upon sin.\nSecond, the assumption that Jesus\u2019 cry from the cross at that moment was meant to communicate that His Father did actually forsake him.\nLet\u2019s take these two assumptions one at a time and see if they are true.\nIs God really too holy to look upon sin? Not according to the scriptures.\nInstead, we see all throughout the Bible that God does indeed look at mankind. We see that God\u2019s eyes move to and fro over all the earth, searching the hearts and minds of His people. [See 2 Chron.16:9; Job 31:4; Jerem. 16:17; Zech. 4:10; etc.]\n\u201cAnd\xa0there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are\xa0open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\u201d \u2013 [Heb. 4:13]\n\n\nQ: What would happen if God wasn\u2019t able to look at sin?\xa0\nA: It would mean that looking at us would be pointless because all He could ever see was a world full of sinful people [which is everyone].\nThe doctrine that God is too holy to look upon sin is actually based on one single verse of scripture in the Old Testament that says:\n\u201cYour eyes are too pure\xa0to look on evil;\xa0you cannot tolerate wrongdoing.\u201d \xa0[Habbukuk 1:13]\nBut if you keep reading that chapter what you\u2019ll notice is that Habbukuk wraps up that statement by asking: \u201cSo, why do you?\u201d\nIn other words, the question is asked assumptively, but then the question itself is cast into doubt as the prophet observes that God does indeed look on evil after all.\nAnother verse that is often used to support this idea that God is too holy to look upon our sins is found in Isaiah where we read:\xa0\n\n\n\u201cBut your iniquities have separated\xa0you from your God;\xa0your sins have hidden his face from you,\xa0so that he will not hear.\u201d [Isaiah 59:2]\nBut if we keep reading [a good idea as you can see], we read:\n\u201cThe\xa0Lord\xa0looked and was displeased\xa0that there was no justice.\xa0He saw that there was no one,\nhe was appalled that there was no one to intervene;\xa0so his own arm achieved salvation\xa0for him,\nand his own righteousness\xa0sustained him.\u201d [v.16]\n\n\n\u201cAs for me, this is my covenant\xa0with them,\u201d says the\xa0Lord. \u201cMy Spirit,who is on you, will not depart from you\u2026\u201d [v.21]\nSo, here, in the very same chapter, we read that God DOES look, and that He DOES see our sins, and that \u201c[His] Spirit\u2026will not depart\u2026\u201d\nFinally, let\u2019s look at Jesus. He was the \u201cexact representation of the Father\u201d and he was the only one who had ever seen God and who came to reveal the Father to us.\xa0\nWhat do we notice about Jesus? Does He, as God in the flesh, avert his gaze when surrounded by sinners? Hardly! Instead, those sinners are his closest friends. He spends so much time with them that the religious elite [who, by the way, were too holy to spend time with sinners], criticized him for it.\nSo, is God really \u201ctoo holy to look on our sin\u201d?\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely not!\nSecond: When Jesus says, \u201cMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d doesn\u2019t that mean that His Father really did forsake Him?\nNo.\nThis statement from Jesus was a quote from Psalm 22 which begins:\n\u201cMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\xa0Why are you so far\xa0from saving me,\xa0so far from my cries of anguish?\u201d [v.1]\nBut, this is a Messianic Psalm. In this Psalm we also read prophetic statements like:\n\u201c\u2026they pierce\xa0my hands and my feet.\u201d [v. 16]\n\u201c\u2026They divide my clothes among them\xa0and cast lots\xa0for my garment.\u201d [v.18]\n\n\nPerhaps Jesus is quoting this Psalm because he hopes to point out how these exact words are being fulfilled in their midst?\nNote also what this same Psalm has to say about what God is doing:\n\u201cFor he has not despised\xa0or scorned\xa0the suffering of the afflicted one;\xa0he has not hidden his face\xa0from him\xa0but has listened to his cry for help.\u201d [v.24]\nWait\u2026what?\nThe Psalmist says that they will pierce the hands and the feet of the Messiah, and that they will divide his clothes and cast lots for his garments\u2026and that God \u201cwill not hide His face from him\u201d.\nSo\u2026once more I need to ask: \u201cDid the Father turn His face away from Jesus when He was on the cross?\u201d\n\n\nNo. Not even once.\nFinally, notice that Jesus affirms that His Father will never abandon Him:\n\u201cJesus replied. \u201cA time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone.\xa0Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.\xa0I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\u201d [John 16:31-33]\nNotice that Jesus not only affirms that His Father will not leave him [even though the disciples will], but that this abandonment by the disciples and the ever-present nature of the Father occurs at the same time: While Jesus is hanging on the cross!\nThis really should not surprise us.\nGod promises all through the scriptures that He will never leave us or forsake us.\nJesus reminds us that He will be with us always, even unto the end of the age.\n[See Matthew 28:20; Hebrews 13:5; Deut. 31:6, Isaiah 41:10, etc.]\n\n\nSo, to recap:\xa0\nThe Father did NOT look away from Jesus while He was on the cross.\nGod is NOT too holy to look at sin. [Jesus did it all the time]\nGod will NOT leave or forsake us, either.\nI hope that helps!\nIf this has blessed you, please share it with your friends on social media.\n*NOTE: Written with assistance from insights gleaned from Brian Zahnd, Brad Jersak and others.\nFor more on this:\xa0Brad Jersak: A Beautiful Gospel in Chairs\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

87,What Gospel Did Paul Preach? [Hint: It Wasn\u2019t Penal Substitutionary Atonement],"October 11, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nWhat is the Gospel? Well, it depends on who you ask.\nIf you ask some Christians today, especially the Reformed kind, you\u2019ll hear something that sounds like a description of the crucifixion. That\u2019s also called Penal Substitutionary Atonement Theory, or the Satisfaction Atonement Theory.\nAll you need to know is: That\u2019s not the Gospel. At least, not according to the New Testament, or to Jesus. It\u2019s also a very new doctrine that didn\u2019t show up until about a thousand years after Christ. It\u2019s also not the only theory about the atonement, or the oldest. It\u2019s actually one of many theories. And, at any rate, it\u2019s not the Gospel.\n\n\nThe Gospel that Jesus preached was the Good News [or Gospel] of the Kingdom.\nWhat\u2019s the Gospel of the Kingdom, you ask? Well, very simply, it\u2019s the \u201cGood News\u201d that the Kingdom of God where He rules and reigns can be experienced today by anyone who surrenders their life to Christ as their King and begins to learn to follow Jesus in their daily life.\nJesus talks about the Gospel of the Kingdom all throughout his ministry, for example:\n\u201cThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand.\u201d \u2013\xa0Mark 1:15\xa0\n\u201cThe kingdom of God has come upon you.\u201d-\xa0Matthew 12:28\n\u201cAnd this\xa0gospel\xa0of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\u201d \u2013 Matthew 24:14\n\u201cFor indeed, the kingdom of God is within you.\u201d \u2013\xa0Luke 17:21\n\u201cAfter his suffering, he [Jesus] presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.\u201d \u2013 Acts 1:3\nIn fact, Jesus spoke almost exclusive about the Kingdom of God. His parables almost always start with the phrase: \u201cTo what shall I compare the Kingdom of God? The Kingdom of God is like\u2026\u201d and then he will tell us a parable about man who finds a treasure in a field, or a man who seeks for precious pearls, or a woman who loses a coin, or a shepherd who seeks for his sheep, etc.\n\n\nBut nearly everything Jesus does and says is to emphasize something about the Gospel of the Kingdom.\nBelieve it or not, Paul also taught the Gospel of the Kingdom. The New Testament affirms this over and over again.\nFor example:\n\u201cI [Paul] have gone [among you] preaching the kingdom of God\u201d \u2013\xa0Acts 20:25\n\u201cWe must go through many tribulations to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d \u2013\xa0Acts 14:22\n\u201cFor the kingdom of God is\u2026righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\u201d \u2013\xa0Romans 14:17\n\u201cFor the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.\u201d \u2013 1 Cor. 4:20\n\u201cPaul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.\u201d \u2013 Acts 19:8\n\u201cHe [Paul] witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus.\u201d \u2013 Acts 28:23\n\u201cHe [Paul] proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ\u2014with all boldness and without hindrance!\u201d \u2013 Acts 28:31\n\n\n\u201cNow I [Paul] know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.\u201d \u2013 Acts 29:25\nSo, the Gospel that Jesus preached and the Gospel that Paul preached are exactly the same.\nFor that matter, Philip and the other Apostles also taught the Good News of the Kingdom [because there was no other Gospel to teach]. As we read in Acts:\n\u201cBut when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.\u201d \u2013 Acts 8:12\xa0\nSee also:\xa0Heb. 1:8; 11:33; 12:28; James 2:5; 2 Peter 1:11; Rev. 1:6; 1:9; 5:10; 11:15; 12:10\nSo, what\u2019s the big deal?\nWell, the problem is that many Christians want us to believe that the Gospel is not what we read from the lips of Jesus, or what we find repeated over and over again in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.\nInstead, they want us to believe that \u2013 based on one single verse \u2013 that the Gospel was given to us by Paul [not by Jesus] and is found in 1 Corinthians [not the Gospels].\nTo them, this is the Gospel:\n\u201cNow, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel\xa0I preached to you,\xa0which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved,\xa0if you hold firmly\xa0to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.\n\n\nFor what I received\xa0I passed on to you\xa0as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins\xa0according to the Scriptures, that he was buried,that he was raised\xa0on the third day\xa0according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James,\xa0then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also,\xa0as to one abnormally born.\u201d (1 Cor. 15:1-8)\nSo, there are a few problems with taking this one verse and declaring that this is the Gospel:\nFirst, Jesus [not Paul] came to declare the Gospel [Good News] of the Kingdom.\nSecond, the Gospel is contained in the Gospels, not in a letter to the church in Corinth.\nThird, no theologian worth a damn would ever base an entire doctrine on a single verse of scripture.\nFourth, Paul and Jesus both preached the same Gospel of the Kingdom, as evidenced by the 8 verses above \u2013 as compared to this one single verse in 1 Corinthians.\nFinally, the passage in 1 Corinthians mentions \u201cthe gospel that I preached to you\u201d and then, after that, mentions a specific emphasis on something Paul passed on to them as \u201cof first importance\u201d. But these two things \u2013 \u201cthe Gospel I preached to you,\u201d and \u201cwhat I passed on to you as of first importance\u201d \u2013 are not necessarily the same thing.\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Paul is obviously not seeking to be thorough in his statements here at all. He references the Gospel without spelling it out. He explains the death, burial and resurrection of Christ as something important, but eliminates the details about Jesus appearing first to Mary Magdalene at the Tomb [skipping on to Cephas or Peter instead].\nSo, I believe that based on the overwhelming evidence at our disposal, we can say with complete confidence that the Gospel that Paul preached was exactly the same Gospel that Jesus preached.\nHere\u2019s what else I can affirm based on that same evidence:\xa0 The Gospel preached by Jesus and Paul was not Penal Substitutionary Atonement Theory. It was very simply, and very obviously, the exact same Gospel that Jesus preached, and that was the Gospel of the Kingdom.\nEven the phrase, \u201cJesus is Lord\u201d, which Paul uses often in his epistles, is a statement about the Kingdom of God, because, in a kingdom you need a king, or a \u201clord\u201d.\nPaul affirms to both Jews and Gentiles alike that everyone who confesses that \u201cJesus is Lord\u201d will be saved. [See Romans 10:9]\nThis means that Paul understood the \u201cGospel of the Kingdom\u201d and he taught it all throughout his ministry.\n\n\nThe confusion comes because some Christians have lost the \u201cJesus-Centric\u201d approach to scripture. They major on the teachings of Paul and wrongly ignore the things that Jesus talked about.\nThey also get easily confused when Paul says:\n\u201cI am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel.\u201d [Gal. 1:6]\nSome Christians even think that Paul must be saying that he taught people to \u201clive in the grace of Christ\u201d and that there must be another Gospel that Jesus preached. As if there were two Gospels: one preached by Jesus to the Jews and one preached by Paul to the Gentiles.\nBut that\u2019s not what Paul is saying. Not at all. In fact, let\u2019s look again at the full passage and please notice something at the end:\n\u201cI am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel\u2014which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.\u201d [Gal. 1:6-7]\n\n\nDid you catch it? Notice that right after Paul says that people are turning away from the Gospel of Grace he refers to this Gospel as \u201cthe gospel of Christ\u201d.\nWait, what?\nThat\u2019s right:\xa0Paul\u2019s Gospel of Grace is the Gospel of Christ.\nAnd the Gospel of Christ is what Christ preached: The Gospel of the Kingdom of God.\nKeep in mind, Paul didn\u2019t think he was writing the Bible. He was writing letters to friends and fellow Christians in various places who were struggling to follow Jesus in their respective lands.\nBecause of this, Paul doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time repeating the Gospel of the Kingdom to these people. He knows they already know it. In fact, many of them knew this Gospel long before Paul knew it. Remember, when the movement stared, Paul [Saul] was persecuting the Church.\nBut we do know that Paul was aware of this Gospel of the Kingdom because:\nA) he preached this Gospel all through his ministry [see references above] and\nB) it was the only Gospel anyone in the Christian church had ever heard up to that point.\nElsewhere, Paul says we should prepare ourselves to preach the \u201cGospel of Peace\u201d [Eph. 6:15], does that mean we have a third Gospel? Is the Gospel of Peace yet another Gospel competing for space with the Gospels of the Kingdom and Grace?\n\n\nOf course not. There is only one Gospel. Paul knows that. The people he is writing to know that. There is no Gospel other than the one that Jesus preached.\nIs the Gospel also about Grace? Yes.\nIs the Gospel also about Peace? Yes, again.\nDoes the Gospel involve the life, death, burial and resurrection of Christ? Yes, but to reduce the Gospel to an Atonement Theory is to totally miss the actual Gospel that Jesus specifically came to proclaim.\nAs Jesus affirms:\n\u201cI must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God\xa0to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.\u201d (Luke 4:43)\nThere is only one Gospel and that is the Gospel that Jesus preached and that Gospel is the Gospel of the Kingdom, as found in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and also in John.\nJesus and Paul both preached the Good News of the Kingdom of God.\nWe should too.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

88,How To Respond When They Call You A Heretic,"October 5, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nEveryone is someone\u2019s heretic. At least, that\u2019s my opinion these days. Whenever someone calls you a false teacher or a heretic, what they really mean to say is: \u201cYour theology isn\u2019t the same as mine. I can\u2019t be wrong about anything, therefore you must be a heretic.\u201d\n\n\nWhat these people don\u2019t realize is that, to someone else, they are the heretic.\nSee, Christians disagree on all sorts of things. This is why there are thousands of different denominations around the globe, and across the nation.\nYes, we all use the same Holy Bible. Yes, we all believe that our interpretation of those scriptures is the correct one. Yes, we typically consider those with different theology to be \u201cabhorrent\u201d or \u201cheretical.\u201d\nThis is precisely why our house church family decided 11 years ago not to adopt any official statement of faith. Because we knew that, historically, every single time Christians attempted to bring unity by establishing doctrine what they actually did was create more division. [See the thousands of different Christian denominations around the globe mentioned earlier].\nSo, I\u2019m pretty used to being called a heretic. It\u2019s actually why I co-host a podcast with Jamal Jivanjee and Matthew Distefano called \u201cThe Heretic Happy Hour\u201d \u2013 because we\u2019ve all been called heretics by so many people that it\u2019s starting to become a joke.\n\n\nA few days ago, my friend and brother in Christ, Ricky, posted this meme above on his Facebook wall. As you can see, it\u2019s pretty dramatic. Plus, it encourages everyone else to label me as a false teacher and a dangerous heretic, too. [Even if they really have no idea why they should do this].\nFor the record, my friend Ricky considers me a heretic and a false teacher because I don\u2019t accept Penal Substitutionary Atonement Theory [a relatively new theology that only arrived on the scene a few hundred years ago], and also because I don\u2019t agree with his view on homosexuality [he accepts the modern English insertion of the word \u201chomosexual\u201d which was added in 1946, and I reject that political edit in favor of the actual Greek words for \u201ceffeminate\u201d and \u201cpedophilia.\u201d]\nSo, we have a disagreement on theology. That\u2019s ok with me, honestly. I don\u2019t personally believe that Christians need to have agreement on doctrines in order to have unity.\nNot only have I experienced this reality for the last 11 years in our house church \u2013 where people who disagreed on all sorts of theologies sat side-by-side every week and never argued or divided over doctrines \u2013 but I\u2019m convinced that this is what Paul was referring to when he said that our unity was \u201cin Christ\u201d and not in our agreement on theology, or anything else.\n\n\nFor reference:\n\u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God\xa0through faith,\xa0for all of you who were baptized into Christ\xa0have clothed yourselves with Christ.\xa0There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free,\xa0nor is there male and female,\xa0for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d (Gal. 3:26-28)\nThe problem is, my friend Ricky believes that I cannot possibly be an actual Christian. Why? Because my view of the atonement is different from his own.\nI know that\u2019s pretty crazy, right? But, sadly, it\u2019s the truth.\nFor him, and sadly for many, many other Christians, the Gospel has become more about having the right information about God. So, if your information about God is different from mine then you are a heretic, and you are also not actually a Christian because you got some of the answers wrong on the theology test I just gave you.\nBut, the Gospel is NOT about having the right information about God. The Gospel is not about information \u2013 it\u2019s about Transformation.\n\n\nTransformation isn\u2019t dependent upon information. Transformation is what happens when we abide in Christ and Christ abides in us. This can take place independent of the quality or accuracy of the information about God we may have in our brains.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but my opinions and doctrines and beliefs about God and other theological ideas have changed over the years. There are things I believe today that I did not believe 5 or 10 years ago. So, whereas my beliefs may fluctuate, my connection to God through Christ never does. It remains constant regardless of my ideas and opinions about theology.\nAs my friend Joshua Lawson once said: \u201cThe funny thing about my worldview is that, no matter how many times it changes, I\u2019m always right.\u201d\n\n\nNow, my friend Ricky has gone out of his way to smear me. He wants everyone to know what a heretic and dangerous false teacher I am.\nHow should I respond?\nI love him. I pray for him. I genuinely pray and ask the Lord to bless Ricky\u2019s socks off. I pray for his marriage, his children, his finances, his relationships, and his connection to God.\n\n\nAt first, I may not \u201cfeel\u201d like doing this, but in obedience to Jesus \u2013 who specifically commanded me to do exactly this whenever anyone accuses me, curses me, or seeks to harm me \u2013 I simply start to pray for my friend, Ricky.\nEventually, as I pray a blessing over my friend, the Holy Spirit begins to soften my heart, change my attitude, and bring me into alignment with the Father\u2019s heart for Ricky.\nGod loves Ricky so much it hurts. And as I begin to pray for Ricky, I start to feel that love, too.\nSo, now I start to pray even harder for my friend. I actually MEAN these words that, earlier, I was only saying in obedience to Christ. Now, I totally share God\u2019s heart for this man and I really, really do want the Lord to bless him in every possible way.\nThis is how we respond to those who call us heretics and false teachers: we love them.\nWe do not respond with the same spirit but with the opposite spirit.\nWhy? Because only love will change the world, and only Christ\u2019s love will change me.\n\n\nI\u2019m committed to that Gospel of Transformation.\nHow about you?\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

89,My Statement of Faith,"October 4, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\n\nSomeone asked me what my statement of faith was today. Honestly, I\u2019ve never really thought about my own personal statement of faith very much. Usually I simply say that I am fascinated by the person of Jesus and I\u2019m committed to following his teachings in my daily life.\nOur house church family never had any formal statement of faith for the entire 11 years we were together. So, I\u2019m not convinced that one is necessary for a functional organic church that is submitted to Christ as the Head of the Body. But, in the interest of exploring the question, here\u2019s what I\u2019d say my statement of faith is, for today:\n\n\n\u201cI believe that Jesus is the exact representation of God. He is the fullness of the Deity in bodily form and we are filled with the fullness of Him who fills everything in every way.\n\u201cWe are loved by God. This love is eternal and nothing can ever separate us from this love. It is higher, wider, longer, deeper than we know and it transcends all human knowledge. Yet, we can know it by the power of the Holy Spirit which cries out \u201cAbba, Father!\u201d within us.\xa0\n \u201cIf we want to know what God is like, we look at Jesus. Why? Because no one has ever seen God at any time, except for Jesus who came to reveal the Father to us.\n\u201cI believe that God is a better Father than anyone could ever have here in this life. This means he does not punish his children for their sickness, but rather brings healing to us out of His deep love for us.\n\u201cI believe that if we abide in Christ, then He abides in us. This means that we are filled with the spirit of Christ and are capable of living, serving, giving, sharing, forgiving and loving exactly the way Jesus did.\n\u201cI also believe that our love for the Father and for Christ is reflected and revealed in the ways we love one another \u2013 especially those who are the weakest, poorest, and most vulnerable and oppressed.\n\n\n\u201cI believe that God is good, and God loves us. God does not cause disaster or chaos, but God certainly walks with us through the valley of darkness and is committed to using everything we experience for our good and to lead us to maturity in Christ.\n\u201cThis process is not for us alone but the comfort we receive from God we are expected to pass along to those we encounter along the way who are also going through similar struggles.\n\u201cI also believe that Jesus is not tribal. He calls us to follow him in his full-bodied embrace of all people, at all times, in all places, from all nations. Jesus is not an American. In his Body we are all made one. There is no longer any Jew or Gentile, Male or Female, Rich or Poor, Gay or Straight, Slave or Free, or any other label, denomination or division.\n\u201cI believe that Jesus is preemptively loving and never violent. He calls us to overcome evil with good, to bless those who curse us, pray for those who hate us and do good to those who persecute us.\n\u201cI believe that by abiding in Christ, we can actually do all these things, and more. Because we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe that no one is a worm, or a wretch in the eyes of God. We may want to think of ourselves this way, but God NEVER does this. He never calls us worms or wretches. Instead, God affirms over and over again that we are loved, accepted, forgiven, healed, adored, missed, and treasured by our Abba. There are no worms in God\u2019s Kingdom, only beloved children.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what I believe. This is my statement of faith.\nWhat\u2019s yours?\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

90,The Kingdom Reality,"October 4, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nThe Kingdom of God is the present reality which breaks into this illusion of ours intermittently, like very bad cell phone reception. It\u2019s God\u2019s way of saying, \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d\n\nIn fact, experiencing and living in this Kingdom Reality is, in itself, an exercise in the Kingdom principles of \u201cLetting Go\u201d and \u201cThe Power of Weakness\u201d. When we give up on our strength and wait for God\u2019s power to come and to move it\u2019s a testimony of our trust in His promise to us that \u201cThose who wait upon the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar like Eagles\u201d, resting and gliding under the power of the wind of the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nWaiting and trusting in His power, not our own, taking confidence in His strength, not ours, is a demonstration of The Power of Weakness in action.\nFor us, this coming, advancing, intermittent reality is counter-intuitive. We\u2019ve been born into this illusion \u2013 falsely labeled \u201cReality\u201d- and have been immersed in this do-it-yourself mentality all of our lives. We need to learn to \u201cRe-Think\u201d everything \u2013 or as Jesus said, to \u201cRepent,\u201d (Metanoia = Rethink), \u201cfor the Kingdom of God (Heaven) is near\u201d (Or, \u201cIt is within our grasp, our reach, and close enough to touch.\u201d)\nIt is very much like taking the red pill and finding ourselves wide awake in a reality which is upside down and backwards from the world we have been born into. At first we reel with the vertigo of a world where up is down and the first are last. Those who humble themselves are exalted, the greatest is the servant of all, and those who lose their lives find everlasting, eternal life, even though they die daily. This is the Kingdom of God.\nWelcome to reality. Because this upside down world, we quickly discover, is NOT upside down, it is right side up. We have lived so long, head over heels, immersed in an illusion of selfish fulfillment and a pursuit of more, more, more, that we need to detoxify our minds and hearts and flesh in order to remain in God\u2019s Kingdom Reality.\n\n\nJesus announced this Kingdom, told us how to see it, how to walk in it and remain in it, and gave us the best news possible: We could enter and begin living in Reality anytime we wanted to.\nIn the Kingdom of God there is just one King; God Himself. He is a good, loving, kind, and wildly, unpredictably, sometimes uncomfortably intimate, inclusive and wonderful King, and Father, and Friend.\nHis Kingdom is a place where His perfect will is always done and those who rest in His will are refreshed and delighted and fulfilled and at peace and overjoyed. They are children born into the poverty of excess wealth and selfishness who have been adopted into a new Family of the unending wealth of generosity and the joy of always having enough to share and give away.\nThis is reality. Before God made this vast oasis called \u201cSpace and Time\u201d there was no space or time. Everything was perfectly \u201cNow\u201d and Eternally present with Him. This is the only reality there has ever been. God\u2019s Kingdom was, and is, and is to come.\nOur temporary stay in this unusual experiment called \u201cTime and Space\u201d will eventually expire and the temporary Kingdoms of this Earth will soon fade away. The Kingdom of Pleasure will fall to the ground. The Kingdom of Greed will perish. The Kingdom of Exploitation and Oppression and Excess and Fashion and Wealth and Flesh, will all crumble and burn and disappear into oblivion. Only one Kingdom will remain and that is the Kingdom which was here \u201cIn The Beginning\u201d \u2013 which has even now come, and which we can enter today. And, one day, soon, this Kingdom will break forever into this illusion we drift through for the moment, and overtake all we see and know.\n\n\nAre you ready to enter this Kingdom? Are you ready to begin living under the awesome rule and reign of The King? There\u2019s just one thing, before you take that leap, before you swallow the red pill, that you should know, so that you can count the cost. Those who enter the Kingdom can only step across the threshold if they pay the price. It\u2019s really nothing when you think about it, when you compare the amazing riches of God\u2019s Eternal Kingdom with the tokens and trinkets of our counterfeit reality. The price of admission, the way to step across, is to let go of this world.\nJust as you were born naked and weak and vulnerable and empty-handed into this world, so you can take nothing with you into God\u2019s Kingdom. It\u2019s called being \u201cBorn Again\u201d.\nThe things of this world are not truly treasures. When you die they will stay here anyway, and just as you can take nothing with you beyond the grave, you can take nothing with you when you step into God\u2019s Kingdom.\nJesus only asks for one thing- It\u2019s called Everything.\nBut what you gain, what you receive in exchange, is beyond anything you can dream of or hope for or imagine. The Kingdom of God, when you see it, when you really understand it, you will gladly rush out to sell all that you have, as quickly as possible, to step across the threshold into Heaven.\n\n\nThis is the moment where many people stop and turn back. Their grip on this world, or its grip on them, is so strong that they can never let go of their tiny, petty lives in this place in order to receive real life and treasure in God\u2019s Kingdom.\nIf we have really seen the Kingdom, if we really understood and believed that this Kingdom was real (in a way that nothing else can ever be \u201creal\u201d), then we would rush quickly to surrender all that we have and all that we are in order to receive the treasure that does not rust or face or disappoint.\n\n\n\u201cFor whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.\u201d \u2013 Luke 9:24\n\u201cThe Kingdom of God is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. Again, the Kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.\u201d (Matthew 13:44)\nAll God wants is all of you. All He asks is that you Trust Him and Believe Him and surrender your meager treasures and petty personal kingdoms in exchange for His Kingdom. God wants to be your God. He wants you to be one of His People.\n\n\n\u201cIf anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me\u201d \u2013 Jesus (Luke 9:23). There is no other way but the Cross.\nJesus says it is very hard for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. \u201cIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the Kingdom.\u201d Who then can be saved? His disciples asked. \u201cWith man this is impossible,\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cBut not with God; all things are possible with God.\u201d (Mark 10: 23-27)\nWill you let go? Will you surrender it all? Will you seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness? This is the only question we need to answer in order to step across the threshold into the amazing reality of God\u2019s Kingdom.\nYou can stay here, on this side of reality, where you are safe and miserable, in your tiny kingdom where your will is what matters. Or you can sell it all, exchange the handful of crumbling mud for real treasure which lasts forever.\nIs your kingdom so wonderful? Aren\u2019t you tired of wearing the crown? Haven\u2019t you suffered long enough under your own rule and reign?\nWhen you are ready to set fire to your kingdom, and surrender your lordship, and dance as the flames consume your empty way of living, He is ready to invite you to experience Reality, today.\n\n\nThere is only One King, and He is good. He really wants what is best for you, and He can, above all, beyond any other, be Trusted. His Name is Faithful and True.\n\u201cI am the Way, the Truth and the Life and no one comes to the Father but by me\u201d \u2013 Jesus (John 14)\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

91,The Movement Will Not Be Televised (But It Will Be On Facebook),"September 29, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nI\u2019ve started to notice a subtle shift in the atmosphere the last few years, and lately I think it\u2019s starting to build momentum.\nWhat am I talking about? Well, I think there\u2019s a very strong undercurrent of Christians who are starting to question the status quo. Whether that\u2019s asking questions about the traditional views of the afterlife, or the nature of God, or the atonement, or even the way we should relate to the Bible, pretty much everything that can be questioned is being reevaluated.\n\n\nI think this is a pretty great thing, by the way.\nI can understand that some evangelical pastors might be terrified at the idea of a more skeptical and discerning congregation in their pews, but this is not only necessary, it is inevitable.\nWhy has this phenomenon been growing? Mostly because of the internet, to be honest. In the same way that the invention of the printing press fueled the spread of the Gospel a few hundred years ago, the internet has revolutionized the spread of ideas and exponentially accelerated this new reformation of faith.\nSo, for example, without the internet it would take an entire generation, at least, for one new idea or differing perspective on the end times, or the character of God, or anything else, to spread across the landscape. But with the internet, ideas and questions about theology are not wide open and flying through the ether like flashes of lightning every few seconds.\nSure, not everyone responds to these new ideas with an open mind. Many want to hold tight to their doctrines and warn everyone not to be \u201cdeceived\u201d by the \u201cfalse teachers\u201d and \u201cheretics\u201d that threaten to undermine decades of traditional theology. For a few, those warnings and that fear tactic actually works. But for a whole lot more people, those warnings are ignored. Instead of running from these new ideas in fear, they excitedly embrace these different perspectives, or at least take time to consider what others have to say.\n\n\nOften, what happens is that people hear a new idea or concept that confirms something they\u2019ve secretly believed or wondered about for years, but they were just too terrified to ask their pastor, or to say what they were thinking out loud \u2013 for fear of being shouted down, labeled a heretic, or asked to leave their church. (All of which are actual reactions that many of my friends online have experienced first-hand).\nSo, the internet has become a relatively safe place for people to investigate new theologies, entertain different theories, and ask all the questions they could never say out loud in church.\nFor example, I co-host a podcast called the Heretic Happy Hour. We came up with the name of the podcast as a joke. Mostly because all three of us who co-host the podcast have been called \u201cheretic\u201d or \u201cfalse teacher\u201d so many times it has lost all meaning. In fact, the terms really mean nothing other than: \u201cYou believe a few things that are different from my beliefs and therefore you are a heretic.\u201d But what people fail to realize is that, while I might be their heretic, they are probably someone else\u2019s heretic. In other words: Everyone is someone\u2019s heretic.\n\n\nAnyway, as part of our podcast, we host a private Facebook group for our listeners to freely post and share and question all the different theologies and doctrines they grew up with. What\u2019s really fascinating is how many actual full-time pastors are in our group. Many of them will post things like: \u201cI\u2019ve got to preach a sermon this Sunday and no one at my church knows I\u2019m a heretic.\u201d\nSo, even while some people may appear to be towing the doctrinal line from the pulpit, many Christian pastors are secretly doubting some of their own church theology and they are wrestling with whether to come clean \u2013 and possibly lose their jobs \u2013 or continue to fake it every week \u2013 and slowly die inside because they realize they are leading people down a path that they themselves have already wandered away from.\nNot everyone who questions their faith is winding up in the same spot. Some are abandoning Eternal Suffering to embrace Annihilationism, or Patristic Universalism. Still others are turning from Penal Substitionary Atonement theory to follow Christus Victor or Ransom Theory. And even more people are deciding to just chuck the entire Christian brand to simply follow Jesus in their actual lives.\n\n\nTo be fair, some are totally walking away from their faith, and from Jesus, completely. That\u2019s sad to me. But at the same time, we\u2019re running into people who have already left the faith years ago and who are now finding the faith to return to Christ, even if they still reject everything with the word \u201cChristian\u201d on it.\nSome might say that this movement is dangerous, or misguided. For certain there are really no masterminds at the controls who are guiding the process or driving the message. This truly appears to be a genuine move of the Holy Spirit \u2013 at least to me.\nYes, there are a few authors and bloggers and teachers out there who are influencing this movement, whether they realize it or not. You probably know who they are without my dropping any names. But their names are not what\u2019s important. What is really important is that the Holy Spirit is calling people out of religious mortification and into vibrant Christlikeness and the freedom of knowing God without fear or the control of institutions.\n\n\nI\u2019m not the only one to notice this, by the way. My friend Greg Boyd also affirmed this observation in our most recent conversation at his podcast.\n\n\nThis is truly a good thing, my friends. I\u2019m just thrilled to see this movement unfolding before my eyes. I\u2019m excited about a move of God that invites everyone and anyone to know Christ without religion, or politics, or doctrines, or fear or control.\nA movement led by the Spirit of God, that no man or woman can get their hands on, is a beautiful and necessary thing.\nIt\u2019s also inevitable. So, those who try to fight against it are trying to hold back the ocean with a feather.\nReady or not, here it comes.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

92,A Little Stab of Fear,"September 28, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\nSo much of what we hear from today\u2019s Evangelical Christians is permeated with fear. It\u2019s almost as if they can\u2019t communicate the Gospel without referencing the wrath of God, or the threat of condemnation, or judgement.\nAs an example, a friend of mine was invited to appear on a YouTube channel to talk about differences in theology with the hosts. All throughout the conversation, the hosts continually threatened my friend and urged him to repent and even to resign as a pastor for fear of God\u2019s wrath and judgement that was surely to befall him if he didn\u2019t start believing as they did.\n\n\nThe other day, a friend of mine shared something online and said, \u201cThis article gave me a little stab of fear when I first read it. Still recovering from this kind of Christianity.\u201d\nI also run across lots of Christians online who communicate much the same way. They post things that warn and shame and threaten \u201csinners\u201d, or anyone who happens to disagree with certain points of their theology.\nWhy is that?\nWell, I think it\u2019s sort of based on the filter they\u2019re using. They still see God as the Old Testament God of Vengeance and Wrath. They see Him as a stern, demanding, angry, and mostly disgusted deity who can barely stand to look at us and is always one breath away from just annihilating the entire human race out of complete and utter contempt for us.\nSo, if that\u2019s your view of God, then of course you\u2019re going to feel the need to warn others about this big, bad, angry, powerful and short-tempered God who can\u2019t wait to unleash His fury on those who dare to step over the line.\nThe sad thing is, this is the very illusion of God that Jesus came to abolish. He told us that if we wanted to see what God was REALLY like, all we had to do was to look at him. He even told stories and parables about how God was patient, kind, merciful, forgiving and most of all, loving towards his children \u2013 even and especially if those children were hateful, foolish, disobedient, wayward and, yes, sinful.\n\n\nThe most obvious example of this is the Parable of the Prodigal Son. Here we see a child who is proud, greedy, and eager to get his hands on the inheritance that will be his when his father is dead. So, rather than wait, he basically demands the money now \u2013 because he literally cannot wait for his father to hurry up and die.\nThe father gives him what he asks for and allows his son to run away from home and live an extremely sinful lifestyle. Eventually the son runs out of money, finds himself broke and alone, and then remembers his father. He decides to return home as a slave, just to have a safe, warm place to sleep at night, and a hot meal every day.\nThe father is eagerly awaiting this return and rushes out to meet him, smothering him with kisses, wrapping him in his own cloak, placing a ring of honor on his hand and embraces him completely. He refuses even to allow his son to offer himself as a slave and immediately starts the welcome home party.\nWhat we notice here is that the father, who represents God, is not angry. Not even once. He is kind, patient, giving, forgiving, and most of all loving.\n\n\nThis is the God that Jesus reveals to us.\nJesus also corrects that old testament notion of God only showing love and mercy and provision to those who love Him by declaring that God brings rains of plenty on both the just and the unjust. Then he says that we should do the same if we want to be like our Father in heaven.\nPaul also affirms, over and over again, that God is loving, and that we are without condemnation, and that His love for us is higher, wider, longer, deeper, and more amazing than we could possibly imagine. He says this love even transcends knowledge. Literally, it boggles the mind.\nThen later Paul affirms that nothing will ever separate us from the love of God: neither height, nor depth, nor angels, nor demons, nor the future, nor the past, nor anything else in all creation \u2013 that sort of covers every base, I think.\nJohn also goes so far as to say that God IS love. Some want to modify that statement by saying that God is also a god of wrath, but John doesn\u2019t say that. In fact, the scriptures never say that God IS wrath, or that God IS anger. But it does most certainly declare that God IS love.\n\n\nSo, even if God may be angry now and then, we have to keep in mind that it is the anger of love, not the love of anger.\nI also understand that these Christians who embrace the image of God as wrathful and the God we must fear do so for a variety of reasons.\nFirst, they have always and only been taught to see God this way. No one has really ever emphasized the character of God as found in the New Testament and as revealed by Jesus. Instead, all they ever heard about is this God we must fear, not the God who loves us more than we can ever imagine.\nSecond, they have done a lot of studying about doctrines like eternal suffering, and they mix that in with all the end times scriptures that talk about the coming judgement of god and the \u201cWrath of the Lamb\u201d that\u2019s found in Revelation, and they take these at face value, without understanding that these verses are written in apocalyptic hyperbole and that Revelation is using these terms in a very tongue-in-cheek fashion not intended to be taken literally at all.\nFor example, when John says in Revelation that he turned to look at the Lion of Judah, what he actually saw wasn\u2019t a lion at all. He saw only a lamb that looked like it had been slaughtered. This is how the Lion of Judah conquers \u2013 by dying, not by killing.\n\n\nWe also need to understand the \u201cWrath of the Lamb\u201d is being used in an ironic way. The Lamb\u2019s wrath is expressed by eradicating his enemies with the sword that comes from his mouth \u2013 the Gospel of the Kingdom \u2013 which transform enemies into loved friends and turns slaves into adopted children who are loved and welcomed to sit at the Master\u2019s table.\nBut if you refuse to accept this, then you\u2019re forever going to hold on tightly to an angry, vengeful, unmerciful vision of God. And that\u2019s up to you. But, if that\u2019s your perspective, please understand that it goes totally against the view of God that Jesus came \u2013 and died \u2013 to eliminate forever.\nSee, no one has ever seen God at any time. That\u2019s what the Gospel of John says. It boldly declares that no one \u2013 ever \u2013 has had an accurate idea of who God is and what God is like. Not Moses. Not Isaiah. Not Jeremiah. Not even David who was a man after God\u2019s own heart.\nNo one, that is, except for Jesus. Jesus is the only one who has EVER seen or known God. And, according to the Gospel of John, the reason Jesus appeared was specifically to make God known to us.\n\n\nDo you know what this means? It means that before Jesus came, NO ONE had the right idea about who God was or what God was like.\nNo one.\nSo, if we want to know who God is, and what God is like, we look at Jesus.\nIf do this, we\u2019ll see a God who is compassionate towards the poor, kind to the broken, merciful to the sinner, and quick to forgive people \u2013 even if they never even asked for forgiveness.\nWe also see a God who is very impatient with the fear-mongers who claim to speak for him. He not only rebukes them, he demonstrates a character that is 180 degrees in the opposite direction from the God they represent.\n\u201cGo and learn what this means,\u201d Jesus says to them. \u201cI desire mercy \u2013 compassion, kindness, gentleness, love \u2013 not sacrifice.\u201d\nMany of us still need to learn that this means.\nMy prayer is that, more and more, Christians today would know the love of God, and the God who IS love.\n**\n\n\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

93,The Chimpanzee and the Zoo by Bruce Welch,"September 25, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n[GUEST POST]\nThe Chimpanzee and the Zoo \u2013 A Parable by Bruce Welch\n\xa0\nMy name is Jimmy and I\u2019m a chimpanzee.\xa0 I was raised in a zoo and my parents were raised in the zoo.\xa0 Life in the zoo is all I knew.\n\nOur life in the zoo was safe, the zookeeper gave us the food we needed and would take care of us when we were sick.\xa0 Everyday was pretty much the same as every other day; we would wake up in the morning, the zookeeper would let my family and me out of our sleeping quarters and we would go to the play area and watch the people coming by to see us.\xa0 About the time the zoo closed, we would go back into the sleeping room until the same routine was repeated the next day, and then the next, and the next.\n\n\nEating times were the highlight of the day.\xa0 The zookeeper would stand on a platform above our play area and drop food down to us.\xa0 We would gobble it up to the delight of the zoo patrons.\xa0 We had many different zookeepers over the years.\xa0 Sometimes they would mysteriously leave and be replaced by a new one and sometimes we would be transferred to a different zoo with a new zookeeper.\xa0 We would have to readjust to each new zookeeper, how he fed us, when he fed us, what he fed us, and how he interacted with us.\nMost of the zookeepers were nice to us, always providing for us and taking care of us.\xa0 Some of the zookeepers would come down from the platform after feeding us and play with us in the play area.\xa0 We had an affection for these zookeepers that came down off of their platform.\xa0 Sometimes though, the zookeepers seemed angry when they fed us, almost throwing the food at us.\xa0 Some never came down from their platform to play, they fed us, and we were glad, but they never spent time with us.\xa0 Over the years we had only a couple of bad ones that would yell at us, one assistant zookeeper actually beat me, but they were the exception and mostly we felt loved by them.\n\n\nOne day I was in the play yard and I saw another chimp, Giles, who used to be in the zoo.\xa0 He was outside the bars of zoo in the neighboring woods.\xa0 We started talking and he told me about life outside of the zoo.\xa0 I never knew that there was life outside of the zoo and the stories of his life in another world captivated me, made me yearn for more than the everyday mundaneness of the zoo.\xa0 I asked him many questions; \u201cHow could you live without a zookeeper to feed you, to take care of you when you are sick, to protect you from the dangers in the woods?\xa0 He told me that he never worried about those things, that he was happier than he had ever been and told me about a secret passage out of the zoo into the woods.\nThat night just before going to sleep I told my wife, Belle, about my conversation with Giles.\xa0 She loved hearing the stories but when I asked her if she wanted to escape she told me \u201cno, I like my safe life here, you can go try it if you want, but I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d\nThe next day, I found the secret passage and left the zoo.\xa0 I found Giles and he began showing me around.\xa0 The first thing I noticed was the grass, it was green and soft and I rolled around in it for hours.\xa0 Our play area in the zoo had a small amount of grass but it was mostly dirt with one tree and a watering hole the zookeeper made for us.\xa0 In the woods, there was grass as far as I could see.\xa0 Giles took me to a river, I had never seen a river before.\xa0 The water rushed over the rocks, splashing as it went, I stepped in the river, rejuvenated by the brisk water and drank and drank the cool water until I thought I would burst.\xa0 We played in the trees, swinging from branch to branch endlessly.\xa0 Giles introduced me to his friend Kenny who took me to another wood and saw so many more new things that I didn\u2019t know existed; stars at night, mountains, birds, trails, and food, food was everywhere we just had to pick the leaves or bananas off the trees.\xa0 Kenny introduced me to his friends and his friends to their friends, there were so many chimpanzees living this life that I had not heard of until I met Giles.\n\n\n\n\nI went back to the zoo to tell my wife but she still did not want to leave the comforts of her confines.\xa0 So, once a week I would venture back out into the woods and come back and tell her about the life that the chimpanzees outside of the zoo were living.\xa0 Eventually Belle was convinced and decided to leave with me into the woods.\xa0 We told our friends our plans and they worried about us.\xa0 \u201cWithout a zookeeper, you will die!\xa0 You won\u2019t be fed, who will take care of you when you are sick?\u201d.\nWe left the zoo and our children came with us.\xa0 We found everything Giles and Kenny told us about.\xa0 We realized that we didn\u2019t need a zookeeper like everyone else had because were provided for by the Senior Zookeeper.\xa0 We never saw the Senior Zookeeper, as a matter of fact no one has ever seen the Senior Zookeeper, but we felt his presence constantly, providing food for us, our family and our friends.\xa0 We found food everywhere, tasted foods we had never tasted before, and shared the food with our family and new-found friends.\xa0 Always knowing that it was the Senior Zookeeper that was our provider and protector. Eventually we realized that the Senior Zookeeper was using our friends and family members to do what the zookeeper at the zoo did; feed us, care for us, protect us, play with us, all the while providing for and watching over us.\n\n\nOccasionally we go to the zoo to see our friends and loved ones.\xa0 We hug and kiss them through the bars.\xa0 Some are angry and won\u2019t talk to us or say we have monkey brains, but most who know us still love us.\xa0 Sometimes we run into an old zookeeper, and we run and hug them like you may have seen videos of, we are still very fond of them.\xa0 Some don\u2019t even remember our names.\nOur friends in the zoo often ask if we want to come back and on occasion will go back in for a short time, but we have tasted what is on the outside and we can\u2019t imagine going back to the confines of the zoo. We soon find ourselves running back to the green meadows, rushing streams, our family and friends, and the life the Senior Zookeeper has given us.\n**\n\xa0\n\xa0Keith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

95,Art As Prophetic Voice,"September 20, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nThe thin line between art that communicates a scandalous truth and art that is sheer shock-sensationalism is something that takes time to explore and courage to proclaim.\nWhen does art begin to confront the culture in the same way that the parables of Jesus perplexed and challenged and offended the culture of His day?\n\n\nWhen does art stop pandering to our basest desires and begin to challenge us to shrug off our complacency?\nShouldn\u2019t real art have the power to disturb and unsettle us?\nThe truth is, we don\u2019t know the answers because examples of this type of art are so rare in this day and age. But isn\u2019t this the sort of thing that our society desperately craves \u2013 art that communicates to the soul?\nLook at how Jesus painted the Gospel when approached by Nicodemus. His response was \u201cYou must be born twice.\u201d\nNow, for you and I, thousands of years removed from this moment and informed by countless biblical commentaries, we understand plainly what Jesus meant. But, for Nicodemus, standing there in front of Jesus, the only response was bewilderment.\nHe tried to get a grip on what Jesus was talking about. \u201cYou mean, I need to re-enter my mother\u2019s womb?\u201d\nHe was grappling with this statement. He tried desperately to make sense of it and felt frustrated, challenged and annoyed.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Jesus wanted.\nJesus did not give him theology. Instead, He gave him something to chew on. Something to exasperate and confound him. Jesus did something that very few of us ever do when attempting to evangelize \u2013 he engaged the person on a level that invited dialogue and further questioning. He allowed the person to take a concept and think about it for himself.\n\n\nWhen Jesus was approached by Nicodemus, He took a creative mode of communication that challenged the listener to actually engage his own brain.\nMore importantly, He did not give Nicodemus the punch line.\nThe Gospels are full of these sorts of examples of Jesus\u2019 style of communication. What are the parables if not simple stories that cause you to ponder the deeper meaning beneath the surface?\nI think if more of us took Jesus\u2019 approach, we\u2019d be more effective\u2014especially when it comes to creating art that transcends the norm.\nRecently I came across a great\xa0quote\xa0from Steve Turner about artists as prophets in Image: Journal of the Arts and Religion:\n\u201cOne role of the artist is to provoke and even disturb us so that we can see in new ways. As the ancient prophets did, art frequently condemns the values and concerns of its surrounding culture-often in a loud, harsh voice. In consequence, the artist is often outcast, rejected, or unpopular.\u201d\xa0\nMaybe the problem is that most of those we call artists today are in reality only entertainers.\nBut a true artist, as defined above, is one who challenges the lifestyle, thought-pattern and behavior of a society, regardless of what anyone thinks\u2014even if it means being unpopular.\n\n\n\n\nWhy don\u2019t more artists take the role of prophet? Perhaps because it\u2019s just a lot more difficult. Perhaps because we\u2019re making some wrong assumptions, one being that to be evangelistic, we must somehow spell out the Gospel in plain English in a song or a painting.\nBut the world doesn\u2019t want things spelled out. They\u2019ve already heard the punch line (in regards to what the Christian faith is all about) numerous times.\nWhat they want to know is, does any of this relate to my life?\xa0 What value are the teachings of Jesus to my life today?\nArt has the power to ask these questions and to provide clues regarding the answers. But, the more important elements of the equation are the question and the clues, not the punch line or the easy answer.\nSure, it\u2019s easier to just look through an art magazine and take cues from what the rest of the world is doing. Maybe slap a cross here or a few nails there and, presto, you\u2019ve got something that other Christians might call \u201cChristian art.\u201d But, if your hope is to communicate something more potent and effective to the culture we live in, then it\u2019s going to require you to think different, and to come at things in a fresh, unique and challenging way that upsets the status quo and maybe even knocks over a few tables.\n\n\nThe finished product might not look like what others expect it to, but as you continue to seek God\u2019s face in your work, and to ask hard questions, you\u2019ll begin to find more and more success at creating art that challenges and inspires and invites questions rather than provides answers.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

96,Table Lessons by Jason Elam and Keith Giles,"September 19, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nOn the last night before his execution, Jesus gathered at the table with some of his best friends for one last meal.\nDuring the meal, He pointed back to two of His early miracles.\nHe took the bread, broke it, and gave it to them. Just like the time He fed thousands with two fish and five small loaves of bread. Once He had done His work, there was enough for everyone and plenty left over.\n\n\n\nLater, He took the cup and told them that the wine was the new covenant of His blood. Wine had a special significance in Jesus\u2019 ministry because His very first miracle was turning water into wine. He was at a wedding and they had run out of wine. This oversight would bring shame to the bride and groom and their families. Jesus\u2019 miracle not only kept the party going, His wine was better, and stronger, than the original wine.\nJesus is the bread of life. There\u2019s enough for all of us and then some.\nJesus offers us the new wine. He frees us from shame, brings joy to our hearts, and invites to lose our inhibitions and dance with Him through the wedding party of life.\n-Jason Elam\n\xa0\nThere\u2019s something beautiful about sharing bread and wine with dear friends. Pulling the warm loaf from the oven as the aroma of bread fills the house; pouring good red wine into each raised glass; toasting to our common love and appreciation for one another; sharing stories of those moments we all hold dear; laughing together; crying together; comforting one another; encouraging those who are low; reminding one another of who we are, and how much we are treasured. These are the basic elements of friendship, and community, and family.\n\n\nThis is what Jesus had in mind when he raised the cup and broke the bread.\nHis body, like the loaf, was broken for us. Yet, we are now the Body of Christ, and when we come together, like torn pieces of bread, we form one whole loaf that declares \u201cHere I am in the midst of you.\u201d\nWe celebrate His love. We experience it, and we share it, and we sense it begin to swell and to grow and to fill the entire room \u2013 like the aroma of warm bread from the oven fills the house with joy.\nBeing in the presence of Christ, and being in the presence of one another, are the very same things. We recognize Christ in the faces of our friends and family, and they help us to recognize Christ in us, the hope of glory.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not an accident that all of this takes place around a meal. God intends for us to love one another. This is how we demonstrate our love for God. If we say we love God and we fail to love one another, we\u2019re missing the entire point.\nWhen everyone has a seat at the table, and everyone has enough to eat, and when everyone is welcome and fed and loved, this is when we know that God is in our midst.\nThis starts small, but it\u2019s not intended to stay that way. The table is meant to grow larger. The seats are meant to be added as we go.\n\n\nThere\u2019s room at the table for everyone, even the people we tend to want to exclude.

97,The Spirit Often Contradicts What Is Written,"September 15, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nQuite often when I suggest that believers today can hear the voice of Jesus and be led by the Holy Spirit, people are quick to say that the Holy Spirit would never contradict anything that had already been written down in the Scriptures.\nThis knee-jerk reaction is meant to do two things: First, it is meant to maintain the Bible as our ultimate authority. Nothing new or different can ever be introduced into our faith system because God\u2019s Word (the Bible) has said everything that will ever need to be said about God.\n\n\nSecondly, the statement is meant to downplay our experiences and subjugate those experiences to the Scriptures. In effect, all experiences are essentially pointless because anything they might reveal to us, and anything we might learn from those experiences, are subject to correction. Therefore, what good is experience if anything that might be learned from it is already written down in the Book for me?\nThe problem with this view is that the Scriptures themselves completely contradict this assumption.\nRather than a unified voice of agreement throughout the Bible, what we observe is an ongoing dialog where one prophet says something about God, and then, later on, another prophet challenges that idea. So, in other words, the Spirit speaks to the prophet who writes down what he hears, and later another prophet also hears from the Spirit and writes down something that modifies or enhances\u2014or sometimes flatly contradicts\u2014what the previous prophet wrote down.\nThis is what the Bible is: A series of progressively enlightened ideas about who God is and what God is like.\nAs we\u2019ve already seen, for example, when Moses says that God requires animal sacrifice and other voices modify this until Jesus gives us the final word on the matter. Or, when Moses introduces the idea of \u201can eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\u201d, but Jesus shows up and says, \u201cBut I say to you, love your enemies.\u201d\n\n\nNot only this, but Jesus also corrects Moses\u2019s statements when He says that God \u201cmakes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.\u201d (See Matt. 5:45) Because, according to Moses, in Deuteronomy 28:12, God says to the righteous: \u201cThe Lord will open to you his good treasury, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hands.\u201d But to the unrighteous God says: \u201cThe Lord will make the rain of your land powder. From heaven dust shall come down on you until you are destroyed.\u201d (v. 24)\nJesus makes it clear in the Sermon on the Mount that Moses was wrong about God\u2019s disposition towards people. He loves and blesses them both the same, and brings rain on both the just and the unjust alike.\nAnother good example of how some prophetic voices in Scripture correct what has been said previously is when Elijah commands a man named Jehu to strike down the entire house of his master, Ahab. (See 2 Kings 9:7-8) Once he obeys this command, Jehu is praised as a righteous man of God. However, later\xa0on, the prophet Hosea writes that God spoke to him saying: \u201cI will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.\u201d (Hosea 1:4)\n\n\nSo, I ask you: Are you still so convinced that the Holy Spirit will never contradict what has been written in the scriptures?\nThe fact is that the Holy Spirit almost always contradicts what has been written in the scriptures.\nPeter learned that when the voice of the Lord spoke to him and commanded him to kill and eat the unclean animals. The Pharisees learned that when they brought the woman caught in adultery to Jesus. James and John learned that when they asked Jesus if they could call down fire on the Samaritans as Elijah had done.\nIn every single case, if these men had held tightly to their scriptures, they would have missed what Jesus was doing.\nPeter would not have awakened to God\u2019s plan to redeem the Gentiles.\nThe Pharisees would have executed an adulterous woman instead of showing her mercy.\nJames and John would have called down fire upon Samaritans before Philip could come and preach the Good News of the Kingdom to them. (See Acts 8:5)\nThe surprising truth is: The Holy Spirit will almost always contradict what has been written in the scriptures. In fact, we should probably expect it.\n\n\nJesus affirms this idea when he rebukes the Pharisees who cannot let go of their Scriptures long enough to accept what they have seen with their eyes and heard with their own ears.\n\n\nThey are blinded by their Bibles. The refuse to see that the eyes of the blind were opened and the lame were made whole because it didn\u2019t fit with what their Scriptures told them.\nSo, because what they were seeing didn\u2019t line up with what was written, they rejected their experiences of God and attributed the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan. Jesus responded to their blindness and warned them that the unforgivable sin was to reject what the Spirit of God was doing right in front of them.\n\u201cTruly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.\u201d (Mark 3:28-29)\nThe greatest sin, according to Jesus, is to deny what the Holy Spirit is doing and revealing to you\u2014even if that revelation contradicts what has been written in the Scriptures.\nThis means that we must be willing to leave the safety and security of our Bibles to walk with Jesus in the uncertain and unknown realm of faith. This is why we are called to \u201ctest the spirits\u201d (1 John 4:1) and to use discernment in our walk with Christ. Because we are expected to be venturing out into the deep with Him, not lounging comfortably in our pew clinging tightly to our absolute certainty, but holding fast to Jesus who is untamed and unbound by any book.\n\n\nJesus was most critical of the Pharisees because they were mired in the traditions of men (Mark 7:8) and unwilling to accept anything that didn\u2019t line up with their understanding of Scripture. He begged them to see that the life they were seeking for in the Scriptures was only available through Him. They refused to come to Him for life because they were convinced that their Bible had all the answers. (John 5:40)\nThe Pharisees rejected Jesus because they assumed that the Holy Spirit would never contradict what was written down in their Scriptures. But, they were wrong about that. When the Holy Spirit did something they didn\u2019t think aligned with their Book, they attributed that to Satan, and as a result, they totally missed the fulfillment of every prophecy in that same Holy Book.\nHe was standing right in front of them, and they missed Him.\nPlease don\u2019t make the same mistake.\n[Excerpted from Chapter 17 of Jesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible by Keith Giles]\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\xa0\n\n\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

98,"Over 7,000 Pastors Admit They Don\u2019t Follow Jesus","September 13, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nOver 4,400 pastors signed John MacArthur\u2019s \u201cAnti-Social Justice Proclamation\u201d a few weeks ago. Over 7,000 have now added their names to that statement, making it crystal clear that they do not follow Jesus in any way, shape or form.\n\n\nOne of the most troubling statements they all agreed to was this:\n\u201cWe emphatically deny that lectures on social issues (or activism aimed at reshaping the wider culture) are as vital to the life and health of the church as the preaching of the gospel and the exposition of Scripture.\u201d\nIf that isn\u2019t sad, I don\u2019t know what is.\nNot only is it disappointing to read the news that 7,000 Christian Pastors don\u2019t follow Jesus, it\u2019s even more disappointing to find out that none of them are ashamed to admit it in public.\nMaybe none of them have ever read that Jesus was born into poverty. Or that Jesus blessed the poor. Or that gave warnings to the rich. Or that Jesus cautioned us about the evils of wealth. Or that Jesus equated our love for him with our love for the poor.\nMaybe those 7,000 pastors \u2013 who claim they believe it\u2019s more important to \u201cexposit scripture\u201d than to waste time preaching about God\u2019s heart for the poor \u2013 never actually got around to expositing those verses where Paul told us that Peter, James and John only had one requirement before sending him and Barnabus out as the very first church-planting missionaries to the Gentiles: \u201cTo remember\xa0the poor\u201d (Gal. 2:10) and they probably also didn\u2019t notice that Paul\u2019s response to that single requirement was this: \u201cIt was the very thing I was eager to do.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the Gospel that Jesus, and the Apostles preached without any mention of the poor. But, I suppose that\u2019s the price we have to pay for living in the world\u2019s most powerful Empire. See, when the Gospel first arrived it was preached to the poor, and the sick, and the outcasts. The people in power resisted it. The weak\xa0embraced it.\nSoon, the same people who hated Jesus were persecuting the rest of His followers. That went on for 400 years until something horrible happened: The Empire co-opted the faith and soon the Gospel was for the conquerors, not the losers; it was for the rich and the powerful, not the poor and the weak.\nOver time the idea of nationalizing Christianity and manipulating Christian citizens took on enormous momentum. Eventually, it was hard to separate nationalism and patriotism from religion and faith.\nAnd now, in broad daylight, thousands of Christian pastors are proud to publically proclaim that they have no time to preach the Gospel of the Kingdom that Jesus taught. They have no interest in showing any concern for the poor, the orphan, the widow, and the outcast. They\u2019d rather preach sermons about the Bible (while conveniently ignoring all of the hundreds of verses about caring for the poor, the orphan and the widow).\n\n\nSo, I guess we won\u2019t have to listen to any more sermons about verses like these:\n\u201cBy this we know what love is: Jesus laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.\xa0If\xa0anyone\xa0with earthly\xa0possessions\xa0sees\xa0his\xa0brother\xa0in\xa0need, but\xa0withholds\xa0his\xa0compassion\xa0from\xa0him,\xa0how can the\xa0love\xa0of God\xa0abide\xa0in\xa0him?\xa0Little children, let us love not in word and speech, but in action and truth\u201d (1 John 3:17)\n\n\n\u201cThey also will answer, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?\u2019\xa0\xa0\u201cHe will reply, \u2018Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.\u2019\u201d (Matt. 25:44-45)\n\u201cSell your possessions, and give alms to the poor. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys\u201d (Luke 12:33)\n\n\n\u201cHe has filled the hungry with good things;\xa0And sent away the rich empty-handed.\u201d (Luke 1:53)\n\u201cListen,\xa0my beloved brethren: did not\xa0God choose the poor\xa0of this world\xa0to be\xa0rich in faith and\xa0heirs of the kingdom which He\xa0promised to those who love Him? (James 2:5)\nI could go on, but hopefully you get the point. A Gospel without reference to God\u2019s heart for the poor \u2013 and God\u2019s insistence that we love them as He loves them \u2013 is no Gospel worth preaching, or listening to.\nNow, I would urge Christians who attend churches like those being led by these 7,000 pastors to leave them as quickly as possible, but I don\u2019t need to. That\u2019s already happening. In fact, more young people are leaving the Christian church than are coming in to the faith. So, very soon, those sorts of Churches will be very dead and gone. Halleluiah!\nUntil then, I guess the rest of us will just have to keep wandering around in this desert of faith waiting for those churches to die. Maybe then we can enter the promised land where the Good News of the Kingdom is freely spoken \u2013 and put into practice \u2013 and those who are poor will know without a doubt that they are treasured by God, seen by God, and most of all loved by God and by the people of God.\n\n\nJesus wouldn\u2019t recognize the Gospel being preached by people like John MacArthur and his 7,000 disciples. Maybe what they should be most concerned with is that Jesus might not recognize them when he sees them face-to-face one day.\n**\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit 11 years ago to start a church that gives away 100% of the offering to the poor in their community.\nHis\xa0new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

99,Mission Accomplished,"September 13, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\nImage: Braden Swope\nA little over 11 years ago, my wife Wendy and I responded to a calling that, at first, sounded impossible: To start a church that gives everything away.\nThat idea came after we had accepted the Lord\u2019s calling to leave the church we had helped to start only 3 years previously, to plant a brand-new church here in Orange County, CA.\n\n\nThe first idea was exhilarating. The second idea seemed impossible.\n\u201cHow will I support my family?\u201d I wondered.\nThe idea of a church that gives everything away \u2013 keeping nothing for rent, or donuts, or sound systems or staff, or pastoral salaries \u2013 was exactly what the first century Christians did with their money. But to do this in Orange County, in 2006, seemed a little\u2026.insane.\nBut, we were convinced that this was indeed what God was calling us to do. So, we took that huge step and did exactly that.\nEarly on, even before we started our house church, a dear old woman named Ethel gave us a word from the Lord which greatly encouraged us. Even though she had no idea that we were leaving to start a house church, the Lord had shown her a picture of a house with eleven windows one morning as she was praying for us. When she asked the Lord about it, He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to bless this family with eleven windows of opportunity.\u201d\nThat word propelled us forward with even more joy and expectation for what God might be calling us to do. So, we took that huge step and quit our jobs at the church in Tustin to start a church that gives everything away to the poor.\n\n\nWe called it \u201cThe Mission\u201d and our conviction was that we were all missionaries with a unique and personal mission to glorify Jesus in our corner of the world.\nIt took an entire year for me to find a full-time job to support our family. But it was worth it!\nWe loved taking every single penny placed in the offering basket at the back of the room and using it to buy groceries for our new friends who lived in the motel in Santa Ana, just down the road.\nWe loved giving away money to single moms who were in need, or struggling families who needed help with rent, or homeless old men who needed a place to sleep at night.\nWe also loved the people that found us and decided to call our little fellowship \u201chome.\u201d\nThey, of course, made it home for us, too. Their insights, their honesty, their compassion, their laughter, and their unique gifts were what made gathering together so sweet for everyone.\nWe also loved that every single person \u2013 young or old, male or female \u2013 was free to share from their own experience of Christ. Discipleship for us was our every moment of life, every breath we took, every day we lived our lives and went to work and drove the freeways and interacted with people around us.\n\n\nFrom the very beginning every assumption we had about what church was supposed to be, or what leadership looked like, or what following Jesus was all about, was totally challenged and transformed from the inside out.\nFor the record:\nI was not the senior pastor of this church. Jesus was.\nI did not set the agenda. Jesus did.\nI did not lead the gatherings or take control of the meeting. Jesus did.\nI did not do all of the talking, or teaching, or speaking. The Body of Christ did, as directed by the Holy Spirit within them.\nIn fact, there were many gatherings when I was not even present, and often if I was present I would intentionally leave the room [especially in the beginning] and would not return until I heard everyone else sharing freely what the Lord had given them to share.\nWe took very seriously the idea that we could have a meeting WITH Jesus and not just have a meeting ABOUT Jesus.\nWe also believed that being the Church was more important than going to Church.\nWe especially loved inviting people to join our fellowship. That meant the poor, the homeless, the outcasts, the misfits, gay or straight people \u2013 even at times Muslims and unbelievers of all kinds \u2013 were all welcome in our homes and at our table.\n\n\nWe also loved bringing free groceries to our friends who lived at the motel in Santa Ana one Saturday every month, and sharing breakfast and the Gospel of Christ with them one Sunday each month.\nWe loved praying with our friends who lived in Tent City, just about a mile down the road from my house, in the shadow of Angel Stadium, and learning to receive love as much as we shared love with those dear people who had nothing but left to give but love.\nOne morning I was praying and reflecting on all that God had done to that point through our House Church, and I was reminded of that word about the House of Eleven Windows. God whispered to me: \u201cHow many windows are in your house?\u201d\n\n\nAs I mentally began to count them I realized: Our house had eleven windows! What\u2019s more: Our friend Ethel had never seen or been inside this house.\nSo, God\u2019s word for us was specifically about this house \u2013 the one we were living in and hosting house church in.\nBut that wasn\u2019t all.\nWe also started to get to know our neighbors. Right away we started hosting Kids Club in our home and invited all the kids from the neighborhood to join us during the summer. We hosted Pancake Breakfasts in our driveway on July 4th and invited all of our neighbors to come and get to know one another \u2013 which was such a blast that everyone insisted we do it every year \u2013 so we did.\n\n\nWe also started inviting our next door neighbors (who were Hindu and Catholic) over for dinner, and then for our Passover Seder celebration, and then just for fun.\nOur two sons also started taking out the garbage cans every week for our elderly neighbors on the other side of us, causing another young man on our street to volunteer to take them in every morning after they were emptied.\nWe discovered the natural presence of Christ in every conversation, and in every smile. Sometimes we prayed for our neighbors when they were going through a divorce. Other times we held their hands as the ambulance pulled away from their house with their loved ones inside.\nOne night we had an angel at our door \u2013 literally \u201cAngelica\u201d \u2013 who had run away from a girl\u2019s home and had nowhere to go.\nI could tell you so many more stories. But the main thing I have to tell you is this: those \u201celeven windows of opportunity\u201d were about more than we first believed.\nOur first clue came about 8 months ago when things at the Motel Church began winding down. Then God closed the door. Next, the Tent City was removed by the city. Then, one by one, people in our house church began coming to us with tears of joy, and sadness, to let us know that God was calling them to leave and start another expression of His Kingdom somewhere else.\n\n\nWe prayed with them. We encouraged them. We let them know how proud we were. And then we sent them out.\nThat\u2019s when I realized that all of this started eleven years ago, and that God\u2019s word for us about \u201celeven windows\u201d was about how long we had to serve.\nLast week, I took a job on Idaho. We leave at the end of this month.\nMy final gathering with our house church will be this Sunday. After eleven years, our windows of opportunity here in this house, and in California, are coming to a close.\nA few days ago, as I was driving home after dropping off another load of books and clothes to the Salvation Army, I felt the Lord whisper to me: \u201cMission accomplished\u201d and I just lost it.\nTears rolled down my face as an endless flood of faces, and people, and memories began to flash through my mind. I saw all the people we touched, all the lives we blessed, all the experiences that changed us, and all the wonder of Christ expressed through each person who called this gathering their home. It was almost too much to bear; almost too wonderful to take in at once.\nI felt my Abba Father wrap his arms around my shoulders and weep with me for the joy, and the breathtaking beauty of it all.\n\n\n\u201cMission accomplished,\u201d he said.\nAnd I knew it was true.\n**\nWATCH A VIDEO ABOUT OUR HOUSE CHURCH HERE>\nOUR \u201cMISSION\u201d TO BE THE CHURCH EXPLAINED HERE>\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

100,New Perspective on God\u2019s Wrath [Guest post by Steven Kline],"September 7, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nA passage in Psalm 18 really stood out to me this morning:\n\u201cWith the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless you show yourself blameless; with the purified you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe conception among most Christians is that God is angry with us and that if we don\u2019t repent then He will pour out His wrath on us. I\u2019m not saying this is completely wrong, but I believe God has been leading me to go deeper than I, and most other Christians, have in the past on these ideas.\nYes, we have sinned horribly against God. We denied him. We believed the lie about Him, that He was keeping something from us, holding us back, putting us down. We took the lie so far that when He came to earth as Jesus, one who was perfect in every way, we crucified Him. My sin, your sin, murdered Jesus. It crucified Him. Our corrupt, wicked, evil system, which is really Satan\u2019s kingdom, murdered God. For that, we must repent if we want to enter the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven, eternal life. This was the thrust of Jesus\u2019 entire ministry for the first words of His ministry were \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is at hand, repent and believe the gospel.\u201d\nBut, for those that don\u2019t repent, is it God\u2019s wrath that will be poured out on them? Or, is it the lies and the violence of the unrepentant themselves that will come back on their own head? Throughout the Bible, we see that the pit the wicked dug they themselves fall into. Or, the snare that evil people set they get caught in themselves. And, in the depictions of Satan (for example, Goliath and Haman), he is almost always killed with his own weapon.\n\n\nThe repentant have become merciful, blameless, and purified. And, to the repentant God shows Himself as such.\nBut, to the unrepentant, the crooked in Psalm 18, God makes Himself SEEM tortuous. It SEEMS to them like God is vengeful, spiteful, and vindictive, pouring His wrath out on them. However, in reality, it is their own lies and violence that are coming back on their own heads (the Psalms often speak of this idea and I could quote them all day).\nSatan\u2019s kingdom is marked by two things \u2013 lies and murder (John 8). Satan\u2019s character is to lie, therefore he speaks lies and is the father of lies. All those in his kingdom, the unrepentant, do the same because Satan is their father. Satan is also a murderer from the beginning, having spiritually murdered Adam and Eve. All those in his kingdom, the unrepentant, do the same because Satan is their father. In Satan\u2019s kingdom, the lies and murder (as well as all evil, violence, and wickedness) will escalate until that kingdom is completely burned down as it reaps what it sows.\nWe must know Isaiah 53:9:\n\u201cAnd they made his [Jesus\u2019] grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nJesus didn\u2019t do those things because they are not in His \u2013 or in God\u2019s \u2013 nature.\nThis is why Jesus could say in John 14:30-31:\n\u201cI will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world [Satan] approaches. He has no claim on me, but I do as the Father commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father.\u201d\nSo, while God permits this, is the wrath His? Or, is he simply letting the unrepentant reap what they have sown? Is God \u201crewarding\u201d the unrepentant according to their deeds?\nCould it even truly be \u201cGod\u2019s wrath\u201d that will be poured out? Based on what we see in Jesus, who is the radiance and glory of God and the exact imprint of His nature (Hebrews 1), wouldn\u2019t this be God returning evil for evil? Remember Isaiah 53:9 \u2013 Jesus did no violence and spoke no lies. He does not operate anything at all like the world and the system that we see around us.\nRather, Jesus, the image of God, returns evil with good. Is this not what the cross is all about? What we meant for evil, God meant for good? He returned the most wicked, evil, vile thing we could ever do \u2013 crucifying His Son \u2013 with good by using that very same act to show us the very definition of love.\n\n\nAll this speaks to why Jesus says that we must repent to enter His kingdom. There must be a complete change of mind and attitude, seeing the earth and fellow men and women in a completely different light, so that we can put away the lies and the violence. So, that God can transfer us from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light. So, that we can be like Jesus who did no violence and deceit was not found in His mouth.\nJust something I\u2019ve been meditating on for a while now.\nSteven Kline\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

101,What If Jesus Doesn\u2019t Know You?,"September 6, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nHave you ever come across a verse and said to yourself: \u201cHmm\u2026this verse can\u2019t mean what it says because that goes against what I\u2019ve been told to believe\u201d?\nIf we\u2019re honest, we probably come across verses like that all the time \u2013 if we\u2019re reading the Bible on a semi-regular basis.\nThe other day I came across this verse and it stumped me for a second:\n\n\n\n\u201cBut now that you have come to know God, or rather to be\xa0known by God,\xa0how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless\xa0elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again?\u201d (Gal. 4:9)\nHmm\u2026well, I can see that Paul starts to say that we have come to know God [which sorta lines up with my theology], but then he does something kinda strange: he backtracks and corrects himself and then says, \u201cor rather to be known by God\u201d, which is a little odd.\nI mean, how can God not already know everyone and everything, right? Isn\u2019t God omnipotent? Doesn\u2019t God already know everything that could ever be known?\nSo, if that\u2019s true, then what does Paul mean when he stops himself from describing our faith as \u201cknowing God\u201d and clarifies that what he actually means to say is that we are \u201cknown by God\u201d?\nWell, before you answer that, maybe you should look at this other verse where Paul sort of does it again:\n\u201cIf anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet\xa0known as he ought to know;\xa0but if anyone loves God, he\xa0is known by Him.\u201d (1 Cor. 8:2)\n\n\nLook at that. Paul, once more, emphasizes that the one who \u201csupposes that he knows\u201d actually \u201chas not yet known as he ought to know\u201d \u2013 which kinda starts to sound like Paul isn\u2019t all that impressed by \u201cknowing\u201d God, or theology, or information.\nHowever, Paul goes further to say that those who love God are \u201cknown by Him.\u201d\nWow.\nMaybe this does make sense, especially if you start to look at other places where Paul says that he considers all the religious knowledge and learning he once had as a Pharisee to be rubbish, or dung, compared to knowing Christ. He even went so far as to say that he resolved to know nothing other than Christ.\nSo, maybe what Paul has in mind is closer to a relationship with another person \u2013 where you know them and they know you.\nSee, nowadays, Christians tend to have an idea that their faith is more about knowing stuff about God and that usually means they tend to downplay knowing God.\nNow, before you get upset at me for saying this, let me assure you that I have been told many, many times by dozens (maybe hundreds) of Christians over the last few years that it is more important to know the right stuff about God than to know God. Not only that, they usually go the extra mile to assure me that it is pretty much impossible to know God in any actual, intimate, relational way other than knowing the information about God that is printed in their Bible.\n\n\nBut Paul totally contradicts this notion. He actually says the exact opposite: Knowing God is not what it\u2019s all about. Allowing God to know you is what really matters.\nWhat\u2019s the difference? Well, for example, I could know all sorts of trivia about Rick Warren. I could find out his favorite color, his birthdate, the name of his first dog, what elementary school he went to, his favorite ice cream, etc. and eventually I could become the world\u2019s leading authority on Rick Warren. But, even if I did all of that, if Rick Warren bumped into me at the grocery store, he would not say, \u201cOh, hey Keith! How are you doing?\u201d\nWhy?\xa0 Because even though I know all sorts of information about Rick Warren, I do not know Rick Warren.\nIt\u2019s the same with Jesus. I could know all sorts of info about Jesus, but that does not mean that I know Jesus, or that Jesus knows me.\nWant proof? Try this:\n\u201cNot everyone who\xa0says to me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 will\xa0enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who\xa0does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\xa0On that day\xa0many will say to me, \u2018Lord, Lord, did we not\xa0prophesy in your name, and cast out demons\xa0in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?\u2019\xa0And then will I declare to them, \u2018I\xa0never knew you;\xa0depart from me,\xa0you workers of lawlessness.\u2019\u201d (Matt. 7:21-23)\n\n\n\n\nSee? It is more than possible to not only know all sorts of stuff about Jesus but to even do amazing works for Jesus and in the name of Jesus, without really allowing Jesus to know you.\nPlease understand me: I\u2019m not saying that we need to get right with God or get our doctrine straight. Just the opposite. I\u2019m saying that we need to sit down in a quiet place and close our eyes and listen for the still, small voice of God. I\u2019m saying we need to learn how to talk to God, and more importantly, to listen to God\u2019s voice.\nI want us to go back and look again at the verse where Paul says:\n\u201cIf anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet\xa0known as he ought to know;\xa0but if anyone loves God, he\xa0is known by Him.\u201d (1 Cor. 8:2)\nNotice that Paul emphasizes the need to love God? It\u2019s not about knowing stuff. That has nothing to do with love, does it? As I said earlier, I could know everything about Rick Warren but not love Rick Warren \u2013 especially if I had never met him.\n\n\nWe need to meet the object of our love.\nWe need to spend time with the one we love.\nWe need to learn to fall in love with God, truly and sincerely.\nLet go of your doctrines. Let go of your information. Stop trying to know God and start allowing God to know you.\nGo back and read that verse one last time: \u201cIf anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know\u201d \u2013 does that describe you? Do you suppose that you know things about God? Are you the wise teacher who feels the need to instruct everyone else around you? If so, please consider Paul\u2019s words here: Maybe you have not yet known as you ought to know. Maybe the kind of \u201cknowing\u201d you have achieved so far is just the ordinary \u201cknowing\u201d of information? Maybe it\u2019s time to re-think what it means to \u201cknow\u201d and to embrace the wisdom of \u201cbeing known by Him\u201d?\nDoes God know you?\nDoes Jesus know your name?\nLet\u2019s start by learning to love God. Why? Because God is love, and because \u201cthe only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\u201d (Gal. 5:6)\nAlso, because Jesus says that \u201cif anyone loves me\u2026my Father will love him and we will come to him and make our home in him.\u201d (John 14:23)\n\n\nThat sounds amazing, doesn\u2019t it?\n[Spoiler: It is!]\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

102,Why Do Christians Divide Over Doctrine?,"September 5, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nIt happens all the time. Christians who disagree over a particular doctrine decide that they can\u2019t continue to be friends with another Christian simply because they hold another perspective.\nIt can be a different view of hell, or of the end times, or of the atonement, or of baptism or election.\n\n\nOr, in my case, it can be a different view about homosexuality. That\u2019s why my friend \u2013 who I\u2019ve known for over 30 years \u2013 called me on the phone last night to let me know he wouldn\u2019t share a stage with me; because I was leading people astray with my false teaching.\nTo his credit, he and I had a very civil and polite conversation. We both shared our views on this issue and listened to one another\u2019s differing perspectives on Romans and 1 Corinthians, and the meanings of \u201cmalakoi\u201d and \u201carsenokoitai\u201d, and when it was all done we were both in the exact same spot.\nWhich, for me, was totally fine. But for my friend, it was definitely not fine. He let me know that he wouldn\u2019t have a problem sharing a meal with me and my wife, but he couldn\u2019t share a stage with me because that would \u201csend a message\u201d \u2013 something I felt was very odd since, in Jesus\u2019s day, it was the exact opposite: the idea of sitting down with someone and sharing a meal with them was a potentially scandalous act that sent a much bigger message than sharing a podium with them.\nWhy is it that Christians today feel the need to distance themselves from other Christians \u2013 even dear brothers and sisters they\u2019ve known for decades \u2013 whose hearts they know to be sincere and true \u2013 simply because of a difference in doctrines?\n\n\nHere\u2019s my theory: Because Christianity in America has become more about being right than about being Christ-like. The Gospel has been reduced to having all the right information about God, and therefore to have the wrong information about God is the greatest sin of all.\nBut, is that true? Is the Gospel about having the right information about God?\nI don\u2019t think so. It took the Christian church several hundred years to work out the theology that many Christians take for granted today. Were all those Christians who lived and died prior to those theologies getting figured out condemned to eternal torment? [Not that I believe in such a thing, but you get my point].\nNo. Of course, they were not.\nThe Gospel is not about having all the right information about God.\nThe Gospel is not about information. The Gospel is about transformation.\nAnd transformation is about our relationship with God, through Christ.\nIn other words: It is not about what we know. It\u2019s about who we know.\nSo, to make our personal theology some sort of standard by which we measure the faith of all other Christians is kinda strange.\xa0 As if to say: \u201cMy theology is completely correct. I\u2019m not wrong about anything. Therefore, anyone who disagrees with me is a heretic and a false teacher.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think we should make ourselves the standard for all truth and expect everyone else to line up to our personal theology, or face complete rejection and condemnation.\nSee, everyone\u2019s theology changes over time. [Or nearly everyone\u2019s theology changes over time. If it doesn\u2019t, you are probably not really thinking very hard about your theological beliefs.]\nFor example, there are things I believe today that I didn\u2019t believe five years ago, and I there are things I believe now that hopefully will continue to change as I grow in my faith.\nBut over the years I\u2019ve learned something about my beliefs: No matter how many times they change, I\u2019m always right.\n[Thanks to my friend Joshua Lawson for pointing that out to me recently]\nBeing right isn\u2019t the goal of our faith. Having all the right information about God isn\u2019t what the Gospel is all about.\nThe Gospel is about transformation, and that involves a sincere connection to Christ.\nI will never divide with anyone over differences of theology. I recognize that everyone is a work in progress, including me.\nOur theology may change, but our love for one another should never change.\n\n\nIn fact, to quote the Apostle Paul: \u201cThe only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\u201d [Gal. 5:6]\nWithout love, we are nothing. All the theology and correct doctrine in the world won\u2019t change that.\nFor the record: My friend and I ended our call last night by praying for one another. Even though he still won\u2019t share a stage with me, he will share a meal with me and my wife, and whether he knows it or not, that sends an even stronger message than he might realize.\nPeace.\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

103,The Healing Power of Community,"August 29, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nI have to share a video with everyone about addiction \u2013 which is not the subject of this article per se\xa0\u2013 but there\u2019s something in this video that I want to highlight.\nTake a look:\n\n\n\n\xa0Hopefully, you watched the video. If so, the key to the video is where they reveal that one of the strongest weapons against drug addiction is community.\nOne great quote from the video is this one:\n\u201cHuman beings have an innate need to bond and connect. When we are happy and healthy we will bond with the people around us. But when we can\u2019t because we\u2019re traumatized, isolated or beaten down by life, we will bond with something that gives us some sense of relief. It might be checking our smartphones constantly. It might be pornography. It might be gambling, etc. but we will bond with something because that is our human nature. The path out of unhealthy bonding is to form healthy bonds \u2013 to be connected to people who you want to be present with. Addiction is just one symptom of the crisis of disconnection that\u2019s happening all around us. We all feel it. \u201c\nAnd the absolute best quote of all is this one:\n\u201cThe opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection.\u201d\n\n\nI would like to substitute the word \u201ccommunity\u201d for \u201cconnection\u201d.\nIn almost every single conversation I have had with various people over the last few months, the theme of community, and the evidence that what people need more than anything else is community, has been unmistakable.\nSome of these were conversations with homeless people, others were conversations with small business owners and with self-employed entrepreneurs. Some of these people were lifelong friends and some of them were practically strangers to me. But in every case the solution to their inner struggle was to find a community of people who would love them for who they are and provide a stable support system for them when they felt weak, or lonely, or tempted to return to bad habits.\nWhat does all this mean? It means that the\xa0Ekklesia of Christ is what people are looking for most. They all want, and desperately need, a place to belong. They crave a true family of people who will offer love and acceptance. They are dying to find a community of support and faith that gathers around Jesus and looks to Him for love, hope, relief and peace.\n\n\nBottom line: We were not made to survive alone. Community is what connects us to life. Ekklesia is what connects us to Jesus and to one another.\nSadly, the barriers to finding community are numerous. Many people are surrounded by those who would love to welcome them and embrace them into a community of faith, but for various reasons these people cannot \u2013 or will not \u2013 make the decisions necessary to prioritize community over things like work, or sleep, or convenience.\n\n\nThat\u2019s been the most frustrating thing for me, honestly. I\u2019ve listened to these different people as they share their brokenness and I see how being surrounded by a loving community of fellow Christians would alleviate their suffering and propel them into a healthier lifestyle. But in nearly every case the person has one excuse or the other about why they must remain alone, or isolated. In some cases the person is reaching out for community but is constantly sabotaged by an unrealistic expectation of perfection in other people. So, when people within a community prove to be flawed, that\u2019s enough for them to justify disengagement.\n\n\nWhat I\u2019d love to do is to connect all of these different people to one another, or to help them discover a community of believers who could help them to see and experience the presence of Jesus more powerfully. But as desperate as some people are for community and connection, the truth is that there is a cost and sadly many are not willing to give up what they have to realize it.\nWhat I\u2019m learning is that Ekklesia as God designed it is exactly what people need to be happy and healthy and productive. But at the same time, there is an Enemy who works day and night to place roadblocks and obstacles in the way to make sure they never actually get connected to Christ through His Body.\nLoneliness is a powerful weapon. It crushes people. It strips them of the connections they need for life. It can even kill someone with enough sustained exposure.\nYes, loneliness is powerful. The only thing more powerful than loneliness is love.\nMy prayer is that those who need love most will have the courage to do whatever it takes to find connection and to experience the community of Christ before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

104,What We Have In Common With Muslims,"August 28, 2018",Keith Giles,\n\n,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/08/what-we-have-in-common-with-muslims/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
105,Top 10 Christian Terrorists,"August 27, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nI recently participated in a debate over the topic: \u201cIs Islam A Religion of Peace?\u201c, but I think we should be asking: \u201cIs Christianity A Religion of Peace?\u201d\nWhy? Because not only does the Bible have twice as many violent references as we find in the Quran \u2013 which involve commands about genocide and war, references to dashing babies against the rocks, commands to kill women and children, etc., but because, statistically, White Christians are much more dangerous to Americans than Muslims.\n\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Here are the Top 10 Christian Terrorists of the last 50 years:\n1) Timothy McVeigh (who was an active member of the Christian Identity Movement) blew up the Federal Building in Oaklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people -including children who were in the day care center \u2013 and injuring over 600 others.\n2) Dylan Roof, a Christian young man who was a member of an Evangelical Lutheran Church and who entered a black church in Charleston, SC in 2015, and shot 9 churchgoers to death, saying he was there \u201cto shoot black people.\u201d\n\xa0\n3) Mark David Chapman, was a huge Beatles fan who, after converting to Christianity, could not get over the fact that John Lennon\xa0was guilty of blasphemy \u2013 for claiming that his band was \u201cbigger than Jesus\u201d \u2013 and ended up murdering him for this infraction in 1980.\n\n\n4) Eric Robert Rudolph\xa0was a Christian terrorist who not only carried out the\xa0Centennial Olympic Park bombing\xa0in 1996, but also attacked an abortion clinic and a\xa0lesbian\xa0nightclub because of his Christian beliefs.\n5)\xa0Robert Lewis Dear, in November 2015 committed the\xa0Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting, in which three were killed and nine injured. He also praised another Christian Terrorist Group, the\xa0Army of God, saying that their attacks on abortion clinics were \u201cGod\u2019s work\u201d. Dear\u2019s ex-wife said in court documents pertaining to their divorce that Dear \u201cclaims to be a Christian and is extremely evangelistic\u2026[and] is obsessed with the world coming to an end.\u201d\n6) Mark Anthony Conditt, the 23-year-old responsible for the recent series of bombings in Austin, Texas, was part of a conservative survivalist group called Righteous Invasion of Truth, \u201ca Bible study and outdoors group for homeschooled kids, created and named by the kids and their families that included monthly activities such as archery, gun skills and water balloon fights.\u201d\n\n\n7), 8) and 9)\xa0\u2013 In 1996 three men\u2014Charles Barbee, Robert Berry, and Jay Merelle\u2014were charged with two bank robberies and bombings at the banks, a\xa0Spokane\xa0newspaper, and a\xa0Planned Parenthood\xa0office in\xa0Washington State. The men were anti-Semitic\xa0Christian Identity theorists\xa0who believed that God wanted them to carry out violent attacks and that such attacks would hasten the ascendancy of the\xa0Aryan race.\n10)\xa0Peter James Knight\xa0\u2013 On 16 July 2001, he walked into the East Melbourne Fertility Clinic, a private abortion provider, carrying a rifle and other weapons and took hostages with the intent to kill all 15 employees of the clinic. Knight, according to the psychiatrist who examined him, \u201cinterpreted the\xa0Bible\xa0in his own unique way and believed in his own brand of\xa0Christianity.\u201d\n\n\nAnd I could very easily go on to mention other Christian Terrorist groups like:\n*Joseph Kony\u2019s\xa0Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, in Uganda.\n* Anti-balaka\xa0groups in the\xa0Central African Republic \u2013\xa0 Committed several massacres in 2014 against Muslim civilians, killing hundreds and forcing thousands of Muslims to flee the country. Other sources report incidents of Muslims being\xa0cannibalized and forcibly converted to Christianity.\n*In China the Eastern Lightning Cult or Church of the Gospel\u2019s Kingdom, is responsible for dozens of riots, attacks, and murders, since 1998.\n* Manmasi National Christian Army\xa0(MNCA), a\xa0Christian\xa0extremist group operating in\xa0North East India that\xa0\xa02009, was charged with forcing\xa0Hindus\xa0to convert at gunpoint.\xa0They also desecrated temples by painting crosses on the walls with their blood.\n\n\n* The\xa0National Liberation Front of Tripura\xa0(NLFT), is a terrorist group\xa0 in India that seeks the secession of\xa0Tripura,\xa0North-East India, and has engaged in terrorist violence motivated by their Christian beliefs, including forced conversions on Buddhists and other tribespeople.\n* The\xa0Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland\xa0(NSCN) is also a Christian\xa0Naga nationalist\xa0militant\xa0group operating in\xa0North India.\n* The\xa0Walisongo school massacre\xa0is the name given to a series of attacks by\xa0Christian\xa0militants on 28 May 2000 upon several predominantly\xa0Muslim\xa0villages in Indonesia\xa0as part of a broader sectarian conflict in the\xa0Poso\xa0region. Officially the total number killed in the attacks is 165.\nI could keep going, but I think you get my point.\nSo, is Islam a violent religion? Maybe. But Christians are just as violent \u2013 if not more so.\nEspecially if you look at their religious texts.\n\n\nWhich is exactly what a\xa0recent project\xa0by data analyst and research marketer Tom Anderson aimed to do, and it turns out that, of the three books \u2013 The Hebrew Old Testament, the Christian New Testament, and the Islamic Quran \u2013 the Old Testament is the most violent text of all, with approximately 5.3% of the text referring to \u201cdestruction and killing\u201d. (Note: The Quran was the least violent text with just 2.1% and with the New Testament sandwiched in the middle with 2.8%).\n\n\nSo, according to Anderson\u2019s findings, the popular notion among Westerners that Muslims subscribe to a\xa0particularly violent faith is false.\xa0Indeed, as he concluded, \u201cof the three texts, the content in the Old Testament appears to be the most violent.\u201d\nMaybe it\u2019s Christians we should be most afraid of?\nDid you know? According to\xa0an FBI analysis of every U.S. terrorist attack\xa0between 1980 and 2005, the vast majority of them \u2013 over 94% \u2013 were carried out by someone who was\xa0not\xa0a Muslim.\n\n\nIn fact, between 2001 and 2015, more Americans were\xa0killed\xa0by homegrown right-wing white extremists than by Islamist terrorists, according to a study by New America, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, DC.\nWhat\u2019s more:\xa0Since Trump took office, more Americans have been killed by white American men with no connection to Islam than by Muslim terrorists or foreigners.\nHere are just a few of the attacks that have occurred in 2017:\n\nOn October 1, 2017, a 64-year-old white man from Nevada\xa0opened fire\xa0on a crowd of more than 22,000 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas, killing more than 50 and wounding more than 200.\nIn August, a 20-year-old\xa0white Nazi sympathizer\xa0from Ohio sped his car into a crowd of anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring at least 19 others.\nIn June, a 66-year-old white man from Illinois\xa0shot at\xa0Republican Congress members during an early morning baseball practice, severely wounding several people including Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House of Representatives Majority Whip.\nIn March 2017, a\xa028-year-old white man\xa0from Baltimore traveled to New York City with the explicit aim of killing black men. He stabbed 66-year-old Timothy Caughman to death and was charged with terrorism by\xa0New York state\xa0authorities.\nIn May, a\xa035-year-old white man\xa0from Oregon named Jeremy Joseph Christian began harassing Muslim teenagers on a train in Portland, telling them \u201cWe need Americans here!\u201d Two men interceded; Christian then stabbed and killed them both.\n\n\n\nDear Christians: We have a huge blind spot when it comes to violence.\xa0\nAs much as we want to believe that we are a peaceful religion, the painful reality is that we are just as violent \u2013 if not more violent \u2013 than other religions.\nNot only that, we tend to believe that a white Christian terrorist can\u2019t actually exist, Yet this flies in the face of everything that has happened in U.S. History over the last few hundred years.\nAccording to a PRRI\xa0survey: \u201cWhite evangelical Protestants are the most likely (87%) to disown Christian terrorists who claim to be acting in Christianity\u2019s name. However, they are among the least likely (44%) to say the same about terrorists who say they\u2019re Muslim.\u201d\nIn other words, white evangelicals find it very easy to believe that Muslim terrorists exist, but instantly dismiss \u2013 and quickly forget \u2013 all the numerous Christian terrorists who have blown up buildings, shot hundreds of people, or driven cars into crowds of people in the name of Christ.\xa0\nCase in point: There was a time in American History when almost half of the Christians in this country went to war with other Christians over the power to own black people as slaves. This \u201cCivil War\u201d killed 624,000 people, and after the war, many Christians resorted to organized terrorism.\xa0As author Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove documents in his book, \u201cReconstructing the Gospel: Finding Freedom from Slaveholder Religion\u201c, the era of reconstruction was marked by several Christian terrorist attacks, such as the Colfax massacre that took place on Easter Sunday in 1873.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Christians need to be more concerned with their own violence before they start to worry about the violence of other religions.\nWhat\u2019s more: the violence of a religion or a religious book is no indication of the violence of a person within that religion.\nOf course, to proclaim that Christians are violent simply because their Bible contains twice as many violent references as other texts, like the Quran, is an unfair assumption.\nIn the same way, to proclaim that Islam is a violent religion based on the actions of a very few of them is equally unfair.\nTo accuse a peaceful Muslim man or woman of something that they are not guilty of \u2013 being bloodthirsty and violent \u2013 based on a few texts in the Quran is foolish, and un-Christlike.\nIslam is as peaceful as those who practice it faithfully. And out of the 1.8 billion Muslims in the world today, 99% of them are peaceful.\nCan we say the same of Christians?\nAt the very least, let\u2019s not judge everyone based on the actions of a few.\nOr, as one wise man once said, let us \u201ctreat others as we ourselves want to be treated.\u201d\nBetter yet, let\u2019s get the plank out of our own eye before we attempt to take the speck out of our Muslim neighbor\u2019s eye.\n\n\nWouldn\u2019t you agree?\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

106,So You Want To Join Our House Church?,"August 24, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nMy wife Wendy and I regularly have to meet with new members, or those seeking to join our house church family, to explain to them what we do and why we do it.\nThis usually involves letting them know that we have no statement of faith, and that we welcome anyone to join us as long as they are seeking to know Jesus better and want to follow Him in their daily life.\n\n\nThis means that, at any gathering of the Body, we potentially have Dispensationalists sitting next to people who accept Fulfillment Theology; and Calvinists sitting next to Arminians; and Cessationists sitting next to Pentecostals; and sometimes even homosexuals sitting next to straight people or Muslims sitting next to Atheists who are sitting next to Jesus Freaks.\nFor most, this is just too much and they have to admit that this is not the church they are looking for.\nBut, for those who do find this sort of freedom refreshing and who are only interested in knowing Jesus, and hearing Him, and experiencing Him, and focusing on Him with others who are also interested in the same Jesus, they discover a community where they are as loved and as welcome as anyone else.\nWe know we\u2019re different, even from other local House Church or Organic Church groups, and that\u2019s ok. For those who are looking for something a bit more traditional, there are plenty of others to choose from\u2026and we are happy to help them find their spiritual home if it isn\u2019t among us.\n\n\n\nSome who hear about our approach are concerned that someone might come into our group and lead us astray.\nI understand that, if you\u2019ve never experienced what I\u2019m talking about, you might think that it\u2019s a free-for-all where \u201canything goes\u201d and therefore it would leave us wide open for false teachers, cultists, or even other religions like Islam or Hinduism, etc.\nWell, the truth is, it would be very hard for any person to do this successfully in a room full of people who are hungry for Jesus.\nHindus can\u2019t give us more of Jesus. So, they wouldn\u2019t find any takers in our group.\nPlus, we wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to advance their own agenda, whether it was Amway, or Dispensationalism, or Hinduism, etc.\nWhen we gather together our singular focus is Jesus. We talk to Him, we pray to Him, we listen to Him, we talk about His teaching, we encourage one another to follow Him, we remind one another of His heart and character and example, etc.\n\n\nIt would be hard for a Hindu to introduce their faith into that conversation.\nMaybe that\u2019s why we\u2019ve never had any problem with that?\nAs you might imagine, we are pretty sensitive to this sort of thing. Anyone who tries to advance their own pet doctrines or to sway others to agree with their particular convictions about anything is going to raise eyebrows in our group.\n\nOr, to put it another way: We\u2019re not afraid that other people might rub off on us. But we are pretty certain that they should be concerned about how much we are going to rub Jesus onto them.\nAnd also, I am not the leader of our group, Jesus is. For reals.\nMy personal doctrines and convictions, etc. are not on display or even championed.\nFor example, I\u2019ve written several books and I have a blog, but most in our group have never read those books or follow my blog.\n\n\nI just finished a series against Dispensationalism, but I have never uttered the word \u201cDispensationalism\u201d in our house church in over 10 years.\nOur focus is not doctrine, or anything other than knowing and following and experiencing the person of Jesus.\n\nSome might argue that \u201cjust saying that Jesus is your Leader doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d\nAnd I would totally agree \u2013 if all we are doing is \u201cjust saying Jesus is our leader\u201d then we have accomplished nothing.\nBut if we are actually working together to allow Jesus to be our leader whenever we come together \u2013 and it does take cooperation from everyone \u2013 then we have done something pretty amazing.\nHaving done this for 10 years now I can tell you that we have only enjoyed more of the presence of the Lord Jesus in our midst and over time our love for Him and for one another has only increased.\n\n\nThose who are hungry for more of Him find themselves thriving in this community and those who want to find a group that believes everything the way they do finds that they\u2019re unsatisfied by our constant focus on Jesus.\nOf course, it\u2019s very challenging to explain what our gatherings look like in a post. I wish everyone could visit one of our gatherings and notice how I almost never talk and how everyone else is sharing spontaneously from their heart about what Jesus is teaching them or showing them or how different people spontaneously encourage one another and pray for one another, etc.\nAs one brother said who visited us a few years ago: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know that you had started this church, I would never have guessed it after what the Lord did today.\u201d\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve heard people suggest that what our group is experiencing is simply peer pressure at work.\n\n\nI understand that we are so jaded by our previous experiences in what has been come to be called \u201cChurch\u201d in America, but seriously, the regulating mechanism in the Body of Christ is not peer pressure [although, certainly it can be if the Spirit is not present in the Body].\nIt\u2019s really amazing what happens when everyone in the Body surrenders themselves to the Holy Spirit all at once!\nWe can probably relate to what it\u2019s like in our individual lives when we do so. But now imagine a room full of people who are all submitted to Christ and who are all seeking Him as their leader and Head.\nImagine that they don\u2019t speak to be heard, or to show off their wisdom, but only if the Holy Spirit gives them an encouragement for someone else in the Body.\nImagine that they don\u2019t speak unless they honestly feel that they are speaking, as if \u201cthe very words of God\u201d [1 Peter 4:11]\nImagine that they don\u2019t do anything apart from the direction of Christ within them whispering in His still, small voice.\n\n\nThat is closer to what I\u2019m talking about.\nAnd until we started doing this 10 years ago, I never thought it was really possible.\nGranted, we are only really beginning to experience this in a greater measure these last 2 years or so, but it has been so worth it to partner together with the family of God to arrive at this place.\nSo, our house church family might not be what you\u2019re looking for. We understand that. But for those who are hungry and thirsty for this sort of group where Jesus is the center and we all work together to keep Him as our focus, it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity to experience Jesus as the Head of the Body.\nIt really is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done with the word \u201cChurch\u201d on it for the last 10 years, now.\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

107,Will Homosexuals Inherit the Kingdom?,"August 23, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nIn this blog I\u2019ll be answering an honest question from someone online who asked me:\n\u201cDo you believe effeminate homosexuals will inherit the kingdom?\u201d \n\u201cKnow ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind\u2026\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:9 (KJV)\n\n\n\xa0\nAnswer: This is a great question, but the answer isn\u2019t a simple \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d since you\u2019ve made so many assumptions in asking the question the way you have here.\nFirst, you\u2019ve correctly quoted the KJV here which reflects the more accurate translation of the terms \u201cmalakoi\u201d and \u201carsenokoitai\u201d, neither of which should be rendered as \u201cHomosexual\u201d as most modern English Bibles have them.\nSecondly, the term \u201carsenokoitai\u201d is most likely a reference to men who sexually abuse young boys, which is paedophilia, not homosexuality.\nDavid Bentley Hart, in his new translation of the New Testament says this about the meaning of the word \u201carsenokoitai\u201d as used by Paul [and later translated as \u201chomosexual\u201d in our English Bibles around 1946]:\n\u201cPrecisely what an arsenokoitai is has long been a matter of speculation and argument. Literally, it means a man who \u201cbeds\u201d \u2013 that is \u201ccouples with\u201d \u2013 \u201cmales\u201d. But there is no evidence of its use before Paul\u2019s text. There is one known instance in the sixth century AD of penance being prescribed for a man who commits \u201carsenokoitai\u201d upon his wife (sodomy, presumably), but that does not tell us with certainty how the word was used in the first century (if indeed it was used by anyone before Paul). It would not mean \u201chomosexual\u201d in the modern sense of a person of a specific erotic disposition, for the simple reason that the ancient world possessed no comparable concept of a specifically homoerotic sexual identity; it would refer to a particular sexual behavior, but we cannot say exactly which one. The Clementine Vulgate interprets the word as referring to users of male concubines; Luther\u2019s German Bible interprets it as referring to paedophiles,; and a great many version of the New Testament interpret it as meaning \u201csodomites.\u201d My guess as the proper connotation of the word is based simply upon the reality that in the first century the most common and readily available form of male homoerotic sexual activity was a master\u2019s or patron\u2019s exploitation of young male slaves.\u201d [notes on 1 Cor. 6:9]\n\n\n\xa0\nThird, the term \u201cmalakoi\u201d as you point out in your question, refers to men who are \u201ceffeminate\u201d. In other words, straight men who appear or act \u201cgirly\u201d. The term throughout all texts from this time period [and long before and after as well] always is used to shame a straight male for behaving, or appearing as a woman. It is never used to describe a gay male. Never. [See more on this topic here]\nIn other words, in that culture, if you were to shave your beard, Paul and others would have called you \u201cmalakoi\u201d. So, your question would better be phrased: \u201cKeith, do you believe that men with long hair or a clean-shaven face will inherit the Kingdom of God?\u201d and I would say, \u201cOf course!\u201d\nSo, why does Paul seem to think that a man without a beard, or with a clean shave will not inherit the Kingdom? For the same reason that Paul demands that women in Corinth in the First Century cover their heads when they pray, or that they not cut their hair short, etc. Because to do so, in his own words \u201cgoes against nature\u201d or is \u201cunnatural.\u201d [See 1 Cor. 11:14-15]\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s was a cultural conviction, not a theological one.\nIn the same way that you and I don\u2019t greet one another with a holy kiss \u2013 something Paul commands us to do in his epistles at least 4 times \u2013 we do not need to regard men who shave their beards or have long hair [malakoi] as being in sin \u2013 Why? Because we recognize that these are cultural prohibitions, not universally authoritative commands for everyone, everywhere.\nAlso: Please note that the very next verse after the one you quoted does actually suggest that Paul himself DID believe that one could enter the Kingdom of God if they were guilty of those \u201cunrighteous\u201d deeds, because he notes that \u201csuch were some of you\u201d and that they \u201cwere washed, and sanctified and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.\u201d\nSo, in other words: There were people in the Corinthian church who were \u201cmalakoi\u201d [effeminate, clean-shaven, etc.] and yet were loved and accepted by Christ, and by the ekklesia there.\nNow, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that Paul would have been A-Ok with same-sex attraction, or gay marriage as we see it today. But not because of anything theologically-motivated as much as it would be culturally-informed by Paul\u2019s first-century framework.\n\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t see Paul as an infallible or inerrant prophet. I see Paul as a person who, like you and I, encountered Christ and experienced a transformation in his life; someone who heard from God as an Apostle and did his best to communicate his experience of Christ to everyone else around him.\nBut your experience of Christ, and my experience of Christ, is no less valuable and authoritative as Paul\u2019s or anyone else.\nWe all have the mind of Christ. We all have an anointing from Christ that teaches us and leads us into all Truth. We can all hear the voice of the Good Shepherd if we are His sheep. [And the Scriptures support each and every one of these statements].\nSo, it\u2019s less important for me to know what Paul thought about something nearly 2,000 years ago, as it is to know what the Holy Spirit says about it right now.\nAs long as we are constricted by what God was doing or saying 2,000 years ago, I\u2019m afraid we might miss what God wants to do here and now in 2018.\nRemember: \u201cThe word of God [Christ] is living, and active\u2026\u201d,\xa0and God is not bound in any book, or confined to any culture.\nChrist abides in us, today. Let\u2019s allow Christ to make all things new in us and through us. The old has gone and the new is here.\n\n\nWe can\u2019t be transformed by the renewal of our minds if we never consider anything outside the status quo.\nAt least, that\u2019s what I think. Your mileage may vary.\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

108,Dear Greg Laurie: Your Event Wasn\u2019t Banned,"August 22, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\nDear Pastor Laurie,\nAs someone who has lived in Orange County, California for about 25 years, I am well-acquainted with the annual Harvest Crusade you host in Angel\u2019s Stadium every year.\nAfter a local business pulled your ads for the event due to complaints, you took advantage of the slight to swing an interview on Fox and Friends to complain about religious persecution, and even wrote an article in the Los Angeles Times to bemoan \u201cour intolerant culture\u201d and Tweeted about how ads for your event were banned.\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not what happened. Your event was highly marketed in the SoCal area. I passed several billboards as I drove down Interstate 5 and the 55 freeway, and the 22 freeway for weeks prior to your event. There was no \u201cban\u201d on advertising for your event.\nAs you well know, there were a series of complaints about your ads at Fashion Island and Irvine Spectrum \u2013 both owned by the Irvine Company. In those two locations \u2013 and only in those two locations \u2013 your money was refunded in full and your ads were removed.\nThat is not a ban. That is free speech at work.\nThe Irvine Co. removed a billboard advertising the Harvest Crusade from Fashion Island in Newport Beach on Aug. 3 after receiving complaints and an alleged threat. (Courtesy of Harvest Christian Fellowship)\nIn your article in the Los Angeles Times, you attempt to paint a picture of persecution and to make yourself the victim of intolerance. But the article itself refutes your claims of being marginalized and silenced by the liberal media or an intolerant secular culture. For example, you point out that:\n\n\n\u201cThis week, my church is holding its SoCal Harvest event for the 29th year in a row. Formerly known as Harvest Crusade, this annual gathering is one of the largest evangelical outreach events in the world. As many as 100,000 people will fill Angel Stadium this evening and the following two days\u2026\u201d\nI have to ask you, does that sound like a marginalized, persecuted minority event to you? You\u2019ve held this crusade for 29 years in a row\u2026at Angel\u2019s Stadium\u2026with 100,000 people attending\u2026?\nIs that really what it looks like when a persecuted religious group holds an event? Can you imagine Hindus or Jains boasting such numbers and then claiming they were persecuted because few people didn\u2019t run their ads?\nWhat\u2019s more, you freely admit that there were complaints about your ads \u2013 not about your event \u2013 and that those ads were offensive to non-believers. But your response to this fact is what disturbs me the most. Instead of taking a step back to ask why your ads offended non-believers, you doubled-down. Your response was to start a Twitter campaign called #IStandWithTheBible and asked believers to post videos and photos of themselves holding their Bibles over their head \u2013 as you were doing in the \u201coffensive\u201d ad \u2013 to flood social media with even more offensive imagery.\n\n\nHow is that helpful?\nInstead of saying, \u201cOh, I apologize. My intent was never to offend non-believers. I love non-believers. What can we do to make this right? How can we communicate the love of Jesus to non-believers in a way that won\u2019t offend them?\u201d, you instead turned around and said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re offended are you? Well, if that image of me with my Bible held over my head like a hammer offended you, then wait until we flood social media with\xa0thousands more images of people doing it!\u201d\nHow very un-Christlike.\nYour article, and your interview on Fox and Friends, readily acknowledged that some people must be offended by the Bible, but you never asked why. In fact, your Times article was entitled \u201cWhy Is The Bible So Offensive?\u201d but then made absolutely no attempt to answer that question.\nWouldn\u2019t it make sense for an apologist and evangelist like yourself to find out why the Bible is offensive to people? Maybe you should send a few thousand people from your Harvest Crusade down to Fashion Island and Irvine Spectrum with clipboards to conduct a survey and find out why people are offended by the Bible. That way, you\u2019d understand what was offensive and you\u2019d have some actual, thoughtful, intelligent responses to offer people \u2013 like an apologist or an evangelist might do if they truly cared about the people they were supposed to evangelize.\n\n\nFor example, your article points out that: \u201cThe abolitionist movement was led by men and women who believed the words in the Bible and took them to heart\u201d,\xa0but fails to note that it was opposed by an equal number of Christians who also used that very same Bible to support slavery. In fact, it was the failure of the Christian Church in America to reconcile the conflicting messages of the Bible over slavery that led to the bloodiest war on American soil \u2013 the American Civil War.\nMaybe that\u2019s one reason some people find the Bible offensive? I\u2019m sure if you start digging, you may find a few more reasons why.\nLater in the L.A. Times article\xa0you also say:\n\u201cWe can find Bibles in nearly every hotel room in America, and most Americans have at least one Bible in their home. In fact, 80% of Americans, including 71% of college graduates, believe the Bible is the inspired word of God.\u201d\n\n\nYes. You\u2019re correct. The Bible is everywhere. And that\u2019s why you don\u2019t get to claim that your church, or your massive Christian event, is marginalized.\nAs you admit, your event \u2013 which is held in a major league baseball stadium and has been running for 29 years \u2013 \u201cis one of the largest evangelical outreach events in the world\u201d, with over 100,000 in attendance over a three-day period.\n\n\nYou are not being persecuted, my friend. Your faith is being celebrated in the biggest way possible.\nTo be clear: Your event was well-advertised on radio and on billboards across Orange County. You packed Angel\u2019s Stadium with over 100,000 people. Your event has been running for 29 years in a row. Your religion is the dominant faith group in America. Your Holy Book is in nearly every hotel room across the nation. You are not being marginalized if one local business decides to refund your money and chooses not to run your ads in their shopping malls.\nYour ads for this event were not banned. One local company simply declined to run your ad. That\u2019s all.\nNow, I do have to wonder what reaction you and other Evangelical Christians in SoCal would have had if you started seeing ads for an Islamic event all over Orange County featuring an Imam holding a large Quran over his head. Would you have just smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s cool\u201d? Or would you have rallied together to get those ads pulled down? Or would you have organized another Twitter campaign to warn Americans about the dangers of\xa0 Sharia Law?\nBased on my previous experiences, I\u2019d have to say that, in all likelihood, you and other SoCal Christians would have freaked out over ads for an Islamic event of the same magnitude as your own.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I only hope to communicate to you that your reaction to this minor event with the Irvine Company says more about who you are and why non-believers continue to react negatively to you and other Evangelical Christians.\nIt\u2019s not only that they find some things in the Bible offensive, it\u2019s that Christians like you continually stoke the \u201cUs vs Them\u201d mentality that increases the divide between them and your faith.\nYour calling, and mine, is to be an ambassador of Christ. Our mission is to be working towards reconciliation with those who do not know Christ, not furthering the tribalism that keeps pushing them farther away.\nIf we\u2019re really interested in the ministry of reconciliation, I\u2019d suggest taking the time to apologize for being offensive, asking why you offended people, and working humbly to build a bridge \u2013 not a wall \u2013 between us and them.\nPlease also keep in mind that success for your event is that one day no one will show up for it. Are you really working towards that end? Is your goal to make disciples, plant churches, and teach people to follow Christ daily?\nIf so, I\u2019d love to hear your plan for discipling those 10,000 new converts who came forward at your most recent event. How many churches will you plant out of that number? How will you follow up with every single one of them to make sure they know who Jesus is and how to follow Him in their daily life? Do you know their names? Do you have a team of people who are following up with them to help them put their faith into practice? Are you setting up Bible studies for them to join all across Orange County?\n\n\nOr, is your plan to re-evangelize those same 10,000 people again next year, and the year after that?\nOverall, I\u2019m not impressed by those large numbers, because to me it betrays the fact that, after 29 years, your event has created a lot of repeat customers, but not many true followers of Jesus.\nI know you didn\u2019t ask me for my opinion. I know you most likely will never actually read this letter. But I needed to say this, for my own sanity, and for the sake of all of those other Christians who can\u2019t see through your smokescreen, and especially for all those non-believers who wonder if anyone cares to understand why they find your event so offensive.\nIf you want to talk about this in person, I\u2019ll buy lunch.\nSincerely,\nKeith\n**\nJOIN ME IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Sept. 15 at\xa0\u201cProactive Love: How Loving Our Enemies Changes Everything\u201d.\xa0Register HERE>\n\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

109,In Christ?,"August 17, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nI\u2019ve started to notice that Paul uses the phrase \u201cIn Christ\u201d in a very interesting way.\xa0At first, I was only aware of a few places where he used the phrase and I was often quoting his use in Romans 8:1:\n\u201cTherefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are\xa0in Christ\xa0Jesus..\u201d\n\nLately, I have found myself reminding people that they are \u201cin Christ\u201d and because of this, they were not under any condemnation whatsoever.\n\n\nEventually, I started seeing a few other verses where Paul used the phrase, like:\n\u201c\u2026the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life\xa0in Christ\xa0Jesus, our Lord\u201d [Rom.6:23]\n\u201cIn the same way, count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God\xa0in Christ\xa0Jesus.\u201d [Rom. 6:11]\n\u201cFor I am convinced that neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is\xa0in Christ\xa0Jesus our Lord.\u201d [Rom. 8:39]\n\u201c\u2026so\xa0in Christ, we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.\u201d [Rom. 12:5]\n\u201cFor\xa0God was in Christ,\xa0reconciling the world to himself,\xa0no\xa0longer\xa0counting\xa0people\u2019s sins against them.\u201d [2 Cor. 5:19]\n\nWhat I started to realize was this: Paul had in mind a positional reality where those of us who were \u201cin Christ\u201d were beneficiaries of a specific set of blessings or conditions that those who were outside of Christ did not have.\nTo further research my theory, I searched online for the phrase \u201cIn Christ\u201d and I found over 33 verses in the New Testament \u2013 mostly from Paul \u2013 which described what life looks like if, and when, we are found \u201cin Christ\u201d.\n\n\nThere are honestly too many verses to unpack individually here in a single blog article, unfortunately, but the truth is that Paul held a consistent belief about being \u201cin Christ\u201d and he constantly referred to it in his writings and teaching.\nI\u2019m not suggesting there\u2019s some \u201chidden\u201d teaching here. I\u2019m saying that Paul believed that being \u201cin Christ\u201d was possible, and that it produces a specific set of realities that he plainly and very openly communicates all through his letters. What\u2019s happened, I believe, is that we have glossed over the phrase \u201cin Christ\u201d as if it were some sort of religious terminology without fully taking the time to think about what Paul means by it.\nSimply put, what Paul believes about the experience of being \u201cin Christ\u201d is hiding in plain sight. All we have to do is start paying close attention to how and when Paul uses this phrase \u2013 and he uses it quite a lot \u2013 to understand what it really means for us to be \u201cin Christ\u201d.\n\n\nOne example of this is powerfully expressed in 2 Corinthians 3:14:\n\u201cBut their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only\xa0in Christ\xa0is it taken away.\u201d\n\nThat is profound stuff because he\u2019s letting us know that being \u201cin Christ\u201d opens our eyes about the old covenant and allows us to see clearly. It means that if we are not looking at the old covenant through the eyes of Jesus, we are blind. Jesus reveals everything we need to know about the old covenant scriptures. It also means we don\u2019t try to use the old covenant scriptures to modify Jesus. Why? Because only \u201cin Christ is [the veil] taken away\u201d, not the other way around.\n\n\nRemember this:\n\u201cIf anyone is\xa0in Christ, the new creation has come: the old has gone, the new is here!\u201d[2 Cor.5:17]Jesus makes into new creatures \u2013 right here and right now. This is a present experience we can enjoy today if we are \u201cin Christ\u201d.\nAs I said, this is a deep and far-reaching study that I hope to explore further in the future, but for now I encourage you to do your own study.\n\nI think the results will be quite edifying.",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/08/in-christ/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
110,Jesus or Christ (Or Both)?,"August 16, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\u201cFor in Christ all the fullness\xa0of the Deity lives in bodily form,\xa0and in Christ, you have been brought to fullness.\xa0He is the head\xa0over every power and authority. \u201c \u2013 Col. 2:9-10\nOver the last few months, I have been meditating on this verse above, along with a few others that express what many theologians have come to regard as the \u201cCosmic Christ.\u201d\n\n\nThe other verses that attempt to explain this concept are:\n\u201cThe Son is the image\xa0of the invisible God,\xa0the firstborn\xa0over all creation.\xa0For in him all things were created:\xa0things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities;\xa0all things have been created through him and for him.\xa0He is before all things,\xa0and in him all things hold together.\xa0And he is the head\xa0of the body, the church;\xa0he is the beginning and the firstborn\xa0from among the dead,\xa0so that in everything he might have the supremacy.\xa0For God was pleased\xa0to have all his fullness\xa0dwell in him,\xa0and through him to reconcile\xa0to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven,\xa0by making peace\xa0through his blood,\xa0shed on the cross.\u201d \u2013 Col. 1:15-20\n\u201cLong ago, at many times and\xa0in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,\xa0but\xa0in these last days\xa0he has spoken to us by\xa0his Son, whom he appointed\xa0the heir of all things,\xa0through whom also he created\xa0the world.\xa0He is the radiance of the glory of God and\xa0the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power.\u201d \u2013 Heb. 1:1-3\n\n\nThese are not the only verses that speak about the Cosmic Christ, but there are probably the main ones where the idea is best expressed.\nWhat I\u2019m realizing is that many who embrace this concept tend to want to separate Christ from Jesus, as if they are two distinct entities who are not dependent upon one another.\nThis is where it gets complicated.\nEssentially, they teach that Christ is a transcendent expression of God\u2019s nature. Jesus was a man who lived in Palestine\xa0during the First Century. They are connected, but not the same.\nIn other words: Jesus embodied the Christ during his lifetime. Jesus spoke wisdom by the power of the Christ within. He did miracles through the power of Christ. He articulated and demonstrated what a Christ-like life could \u2013 and should \u2013 look like. But Christ is not Jesus and Jesus is not Christ. Or, better yet: Christ is not merely Jesus and Jesus is not only Christ. [If that makes sense].\nThe key to all of this is that Jesus is not the only being capable of embodying the Christ. We are all in Christ and we are all potentially connected to God through Christ.\nThis is supported by numerous New Testament scriptures, by the way. It may sound New Age to some, but all of it comes directly from the writings of the Apostle Paul, [or whoever wrote Ephesians and Colossians].\n\n\nPaul affirms over and over again that everything that is true of Christ is also true of us, if we are in Christ. [And this last caveat is crucial to the differences I have with those who typically want to separate Christ and Jesus. More on that in a moment].\nHere are a few verses from Paul, and a few from Jesus, that affirm our connection to Jesus [and to Christ]:\n\u201cIf anyone is\xa0in Christ, the new creation has come: the old has gone, the new is here!\u201d \u2013 2 Cor.5:17\n\u201cFor in Christ all the fullness\xa0of the Deity lives in bodily form,\xa0and in Christ, you have been brought to fullness.\xa0He is the head\xa0over every power and authority. \u201c \u2013 Col. 2:9-10\n\u201cOn that day\xa0you will realize that I am in my Father,\xa0and you are in me, and I am in you.\u201d \u2013 John 14:20\n\u201cI have given them the glory that you gave me,\xa0that they may be one as we are one\u2014\xa0I in them and you in me\u2014so that they may be brought to complete unity.\u201d \u2013 John 17:22-23\n\n\nWithout going too in-depth here, I\u2019d like to point out that in the verses where Paul speaks of Christ [and he does usually speak more about \u201cChrist\u201d than he does about \u201cJesus\u201d], he always makes references to Jesus\u2019s life, death, crucifixion, and resurrection.\nThe reason I want to stress this is that often those who want to separate Jesus from the Christ will use the fact that Paul uses \u201cChrist\u201d and not \u201cJesus\u201d to prove that Paul wasn\u2019t talking about the man Jesus but the spiritual concept of Christ.\nMy point is that if this is what Paul meant, then I don\u2019t see why he would constantly connect the Christ to the person of Jesus.\nAs an example:\n\u201cAnd he is the head\xa0of the body, the church;\xa0he is the beginning and the firstborn\xa0from among the dead,\xa0so that in everything he might have the supremacy.\xa0For God was pleased\xa0to have all his fullness\xa0dwell in him,\xa0\xa0and through him to reconcile\xa0to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven,\xa0by making peace\xa0through his blood,\xa0shed on the cross.\u201d \u2013 Col. 1:18-20\n\n\n\n\nSee? Here, as Paul expounds on the Christ, he makes two specific references to the crucifixion of Jesus. No, he does not use the name of Jesus, but there is no doubt that Paul is thinking of Jesus of Nazareth as he speaks about the cosmic reality of Christ. To Paul, they are one and the same.\nSo, I do not accept the idea that Jesus and Christ are two different entities.\nHowever, I do affirm that \u2013 because of Jesus \u2013 you and I now have an opportunity to embody Christ in the exact same way as Jesus did.\nFor example:\n\u201cThe\xa0Spirit\xa0of God, who\xa0raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just as God\xa0raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bodies by this\xa0same Spirit\xa0living within you.\u201d \u2013\xa0Romans 8:11\n\xa0\u201cI pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened\xa0in order that you may know\u2026his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power\xa0is the same as the mighty strength\xa0he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead\xa0and seated him at his right hand\xa0in the heavenly realms\u2026And God placed all things under his feet\xa0and appointed him to be head\xa0over everything for the church,\xa0which is his body,\xa0the fullness of him\xa0who fills everything in every way.\u201d \u2013 Eph. 1:18-23\n\n\nVerses like these -and there are many others just like them \u2013 affirm that you and I [if we are in Christ] are now the actual incarnation of Christ in the world today.\nSo, you and I could honestly say: \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen me, you have seen the Father [and Christ]\u201d\nOr, at least, that\u2019s the ultimate intention of the ongoing incarnation of Christ through his Body.\nNow, to be fair, those who separate Jesus from Christ are quick to point out where Paul seems to affirm the idea that everyone is already in Christ. When Paul speaks to the idol-worshipping pagans in Athens, he tells them that they are already in Christ because he identifies the \u201cunknown god\u201d as Christ, \u201cthe one in whom we all live and move and have our being\u201d, and even declares that they are already God\u2019s offspring, or children of God, by default. [See Acts 17:28]\nThere is also the verse where Paul affirms that Christ holds all things together, which suggests that nothing can exist apart from Christ. [See Col. 1:17]\nI\u2019m very open to all of that, by the way. But, I would say that what Paul is really saying is that \u2013 while everyone is already in Christ \u2013 they don\u2019t realize this reality yet. Until we understand what it means to be in Christ, and how to intentionally live out of that reality, we cannot fully enjoy the many benefits of being in Christ.\n\n\nSo, yes, everyone is already in Christ. Yes, everyone is already a child of God. But, if we don\u2019t develop this understanding and learn to live out of the life of Christ, we might as well not be.\nAnd, to me, the best way to understand what it means to be in Christ and to live out of that reality is to follow Jesus.\nThe entire reason Jesus came to was to show us who God is, and who we are. This is why we need to learn to abide in Jesus and to allow Jesus to abide in us. This is why we need to not only listen to the words of Jesus, we need to start putting those words into practice.\nJesus is our blueprint for understanding who God is, and who we are. Jesus is our touchpoint to the entire Christ reality.\nThey are one and the same. And by being one with Christ we realize our connection to God, and to everyone else.\nWhat do you think?\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

111,What If Christianity Looked More Like Jesus and Less Like Paul (Or Moses)?,"August 14, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nMy friend asked a question today: \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a new form of Christianity quietly forming?\u201d\nTo which I responded \u201cYep.\u201d\nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s a good thing\u2026\n\nWhat I see happening is more Christians learning to embrace Jesus for His actual teachings from the Sermon on the Mount, which include loving God, loving others, showing mercy, forgiving quickly, sharing freely, and embracing those who are not like us.\n\n\nThis shift is also one that veers away from things like tribalism, legalism, division over doctrine, fear of others and a need to control people.\nIn other words: I believe we\u2019re starting to see a movement that veers away from Paul and Moses and nearer to the heart of Christ.\nThis is a good thing. A very, very good thing.\nIt\u2019s always bothered me that those who take the name \u201cChristian\u201d have almost never really been very \u201cChrist-like\u201d in their behavior or attitudes or lifestyle.\nInstead, I\u2019ve been disheartened to see \u201cChristians\u201d who look very little like Christ.\nDallas Willard used to call these \u201cVampire Christians\u201d because, as he put it, they only wanted enough of Jesus\u2019s blood to save them from hell, but had no intentions of actually following Jesus or putting His words into daily practice.\nWe need less \u201cVampire Christians\u201d in our world today and more \u201cJesus-lovers.\u201d\nThe good news is, this is a growing trend in America today. We see more young people abandoning the mainstream Christian church in favor of more authentic, simple, tangible expressions of Christlike community. Some meet in bars, or in homes, or in coffee shops, or even online. In my experience, these younger believers really don\u2019t care what you believe as much as they care that you\u2019re honest, you love others, and you\u2019re trying to know God better by paying attention to what Jesus revealed to us about who the Father is and what the Father is like.\n\n\nIn our own house church community, this has been very liberating. We come together to meet with Jesus, not just have a meeting about Jesus. We focus on Jesus. We talk to Jesus. We listen to Jesus. We do our best to put the words of Jesus into practice. We help one another to follow Jesus. We encourage one another and support one another without trying to fix one another.\nIt\u2019s glorious.\nAnd I see that many others are starting to seek out this kind of community and to let go of all the religious baggage that others have tried to place between Jesus and those who want to know Him better.\nHonestly, one huge component of this new spiritual renaissance of Jesus-following has been thanks to the internet. Now, like no other time in history, are people regularly exposed to new ways of thinking, alternative ways of seeing, and better ways of being connected to Christ, and to one another, without all the fear and control that usually accompanies religious movements.\nPeople who just want Jesus are finding that it\u2019s easier than ever to have that connection with Jesus apart from the top-down, hierarchical, denominational control systems that prevent us from asking questions, embracing mystery, and finding common ground with people who happen to think differently.\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve grown by connecting online with people like Brad Jersak, Brian Zahnd, Greg Boyd, Bruxy Cavey, David Bentley-Hart, Peter Enns, Derek Flood, Mathew Distefano, Richard Murray, Steve Kline, Chuck McKnight and others.\nI\u2019ve also really enjoyed hearing fresh new voices like Seth Price [CanISayThisAtChurch? Podcast], Brandon Andress [OutsideTheWalls Podcast], Jon Scott [Holy Heretics Podcast], Peter Rollo [Rival Nations], Peter Enns [TheBibleForNormalPeople Podcast] and many, many others who are giving a voice, and a platform, for these kinds of Jesus-lovers to share their ideas and help set people free from fear and control.\nThe movement is growing. People are throwing off the shackles of dead mainstream religion and running after life-giving relationships with Jesus, and they\u2019re finding more people just like them who only want more of Jesus.\nHow beautiful is it to see people letting go of their fears? How glorious is it to see people accepting their identity in Christ? How liberating is it to see people from different backgrounds genuinely love and embrace one another as friends? How amazing is it to meet people who aren\u2019t afraid to love, or to be loved?\n\n\nCan you imagine loving people more than you love doctrine?\nCan you imagine serving people more than condemning people?\nCan you imagine admitting you might be wrong more than you insist on being right?\nCan you imagine abandoning the false security of certainty for the sincere wonder and awe of the mystery of Christ?\nThis is a more Christlike Christianity.\nThe end result will be this: A world where more people are free to love others regardless of their race, creed, culture, denomination, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, or anything else.\nAlmost no one should be against such a thing, but those who are most against it are those who most proudly wear the name of \u201cChristian,\u201d and that\u2019s not very Christ-like.\nIs it?\n**\nKeith Giles\u2019s best-selling new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nJOIN ME IN EL PASO, TEXAS:\xa0August 18th for the \u201cJesus Unbound Book Release Party.\u201d This is a FREE event.

112,The Unbelievable Truth: Jesus Really Sets Us Free,"August 8, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nPart 7 in the Unbelievable Truth Series.\n\nMy internet friend, Brant Hansen, said something the other day that inspired me to write today\u2019s blog.\nWhat Brant noted was that we tend draw the line between good people and bad people. If we do good things, God will accept and love us, but if we do bad things then God will hate us and punish us. But, as he wisely pointed out, Jesus never drew those distinctions between good people and bad people. Instead, Jesus seemed to always draw a distinction between proud people and humble people.\n\n\nHumble people receive God\u2019s mercy and grace, but God opposes proud people. (See James 4:6, 1 Peter 5:5, Proverbs 3:34)\nWhat matters, then, is not \u201cbeing good\u201d or \u201cbeing bad\u201d but coming to God with humility.\nSee, God isn\u2019t looking for a few good men. He already knows there aren\u2019t any. Instead, God is looking for humble people who are willing to receive His wonderful gift of life and justification through faith.\nI was also looking again at a series of verses in Acts 13:38-41 where Paul affirms something equally amazing, saying:\n\u201cThrough Jesus, the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you\u2026everyone who believes is set free from every sin \u2013 a justification you were not able to obtain under the Law of Moses.\u201d\nMost of us don\u2019t really get that. In fact, that\u2019s why Paul goes on to quote Habakkuk 1:5:\n\u201cI am doing something that you will not believe, even when someone explains it to you!\u201d (quoted in Acts 13:41)\nWhat\u2019s the thing that we cannot believe? It\u2019s the idea that Jesus has \u201cset (us) free from every sin\u201d and that we are now fully and totally justified under the Law of Moses \u2013 AS IF WE KEPT THE LAW PERFECTLY. Even though we don\u2019t keep the Law perfectly (because we can\u2019t), Jesus DID keep the Law of Moses perfectly and then (get this) He transferred that justification to every single one of those who put their trust in Him.\n\n\nWow.\nWhat if we actually believed this message? Well, if we did it would mean that we would live like people who were not condemned for their failures. We would live like people who really believed this:\n\u201cTherefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death. For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\u201d (Romans 8:1-4)\nOver the weekend I was sharing this exact verse with a brother in Christ, and after I told him this he said:\n\u201cHow awful to miss what Jesus has done for me on the cross.\u201d\nThat is exactly what someone might say who hasn\u2019t yet understood Romans 8, and Acts 13 because after hearing this truth our first reaction is to put ourselves right back under condemnation again.\n\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t do that.\nThe point for us is that Jesus has set us free from every sin and has justified us \u201cas if we kept the Law of Moses perfectly\u201d because Jesus DID do that in our place, and then He shared that work with all of us.\nSo, rather than being down on yourself for not seeing it \u2013 just see it and accept it and start walking in the light of a new day. Simply rejoice in the freedom that Jesus has given you and the FACT that you are set free from sin and from all condemnation!\nGo ahead and say, \u201cWoo-hoo!\u201d\nYou might even want to jump for joy. I\u2019m serious. Find a private place where no one is around and jump into the air and say \u201cPraise God!\u201d because that\u2019s an appropriate response.\nTry it!

113,Limited Negatives: Making Sense of How Jesus Speaks,"August 7, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nQuite often in the Gospels, Jesus \u2013 and other Gospel writers \u2013 will use a common Hebraic figure of speech called a \u201cLimited Negative\u201d to emphasize a point.\nA limited negative is often constructed like this:\n\u201cNot A, but B\u201d.\nFor example: \u201c\u2026children who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\u201d [John 1:13]\n\n\nWhat the writer actually means is: \u201cNot only A\u2026but also B\u201d or, sometimes: \u201cNot merely A\u2026but primarily B\u201d\nSuch an idiom becomes recognizable when it would be absurd or contradictory to take an absolute-sounding statement in its absolute sense.\nIn the example above, it would be foolish to try to use this verse to teach that the children of God are NOT born of blood or flesh. That would be ridiculous. Of course, Christians are \u201cborn..of blood\u201d and \u201cof the will of the flesh\u201d, but the phrase is meant to illustrate that we are not merely born of the flesh, but primarily \u2013 in a greater way \u2013 born of the Spirit.\nOnce you recognize this as a common idiom and figure of speech, you can easily understand many other verses of scripture from this same perspective.\nHere are a few more examples of limited negatives:\n\u201cDo not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life.\u201d (John 6:27)\n\nMeaning: \u201cDo not work ONLY for natural sustenance, but MAINLY for your spiritual sustenance\u201d\n\u201cHe who believes in me believes not in me, but in him who sent me\u201d (John 12:44)\n\nMeaning: \u201cHe who believes in me, believes NOT ONLY in me, but ALSO in him who sent me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2026for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.\u201d (Matthew 10:20)\n\nMeaning: \u201cIt is not ONLY you speaking, but it is MAINLY the Spirit of God speaking through you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI did not come to bring peace, but a sword.\u201d (Matthew 10:34)\n\nMeaning: \u201cI did not come ONLY to bring peace, but ALSO to bring a sword.\u201d\nAnd what sort of \u201csword\u201d did Jesus intend to bring? The context of the verse tells us that he is referring to division between father and son and brother and sister, etc. as some may accept Christ and others may reject Him as Messiah.\nThis verse is not about war. It\u2019s about how a decision to follow Christ may cost you relationships, and this is why He also tells us to \u201ccount the cost\u201d of being His disciple.\nHopefully, this helps you to better understand Jesus and the other New Testament writers when they use language like this and not get confused as if they are making absolute statements about literal truth.\n**\nKeith Giles\u2019s new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nJOIN ME IN EL PASO, TEXAS:\xa0August 18th for the \u201cJesus Unbound Book Release Party.\u201d This is a FREE event.

114,The Unbelievable Truth: God Really Wants Us To Love Our Enemies,"August 6, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nPart 6 in the Unbelievable Truth Series\n\nIn our previous installment, we talked about how hard it is for Christians to believe that God really loves filthy sinners like killers and rapists and terrorists.\nThis article examines a very closely related truth which Christians equally struggle with: The idea that God really wants us to love our enemies too.\n\n\nBecause we can\u2019t accept that God would love evil people, it just follows that we can\u2019t believe that God would expect us to love them either. Of course, the truth is that God really does love evil people and that means that He really does expect us to do the same.\nEven if we can accept this teaching in general, or in theory, it is much more challenging to actually take the step of loving our enemies or\xa0sincerely pray for these people to receive forgiveness or mercy or grace.\nSo, when we see the face of a terrorist or a murderer on the news our first impulse is not to stop and pray for that person to be saved and healed and forgiven. But that is what we should do if we are truly followers of Jesus.\nJesus commanded us specifically and in no uncertain terms to love our enemies and to bless those who curse us, and to do good to those who hate us. If we are to treat people who directly harm us and hate us like this, how much more should we love and bless those who have harmed others? Especially since the basis for these actions is found in the character of God. In other words, Jesus appeals to the loving and forgiving nature of God as our model for showing this same kind of love and mercy.\n\n\n\u201cBut I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\u201d (Matt. 5:44-45)\nOne of the main reasons that we find it so hard to love our enemies, I believe, is that we\u2019re more influenced by our human nature than by our spiritual nature. We also make the mistake of thinking that loving our enemies is equal to approving of their behaviors, but that\u2019s not the case. We can show love to people and extend mercy to them without accepting their actions. For example, my wife and I routinely help and serve people who are homeless. Many of them are addicted to heroin or meth. Do we approve of their drug use? Or their prostitution? Of course not. But that doesn\u2019t prevent us from showing them love and mercy and extending the grace of God to them.\n\n\nIf we really hope to be ambassadors of Christ to a world full of imperfect people, we must admit that we are among the imperfect, and then we must allow God to fill us with His perfect love for others, especially those who (in our opinion) do not deserve it.\n\n\nIf we stop and think we\u2019ll realize that none of us deserves the love and mercy of God, but we all need it very, very much.\nWhat do you think?\n**\nKeith Giles\u2019s new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nJOIN ME IN EL PASO, TEXAS: August 18th for the \u201cJesus Unbound Book Release Party.\u201d This is a FREE event.

115,What If We Actually Create Reality By Observation?,"August 2, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\nIf we\u2019re not here to observe the Universe, does it cease to exist?\nWhat if Christ in us is what created the Universe, and it holds together because we are here to observe it?\n\u201cNow do you believe that I am in you and you are in me and we are in Him?\u201d\n\n\nWhat am I talking about?\nWell, honestly, I\u2019m not sure. But I think it all starts with this:\n\u201cOne of the most bizarre premises of quantum theory, which has long fascinated philosophers and physicists alike, states that by the very act of watching, the observer affects the observed reality.\n\u201cIn a study reported in the February 26 issue of Nature (Vol. 391, pp. 871-874), researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science\u2026conducted a highly controlled experiment demonstrating how a beam of electrons is affected by the act of being observed.\n\u201cThe experiment revealed that the greater the amount of \u201cwatching,\u201d the greater the observer\u2019s influence on what actually takes place.\u201d\n\u201cWhen a quantum \u201cobserver\u201d is watching Quantum mechanics states that particles can also behave as waves. This can be true for electrons at the submicron level, i.e., at distances measuring less than one micron, or one-thousandth of a millimeter. When behaving as waves, they can simultaneously pass through several openings in a barrier and then meet again at the other side of the barrier. This \u201cmeeting\u201d is known as interference.\n\u201cStrange as it may sound, interference can only occur when no one is watching. Once an observer begins to watch the particles going through the openings, the picture changes dramatically: if a particle can be seen going through one opening, then it\u2019s clear it didn\u2019t go through another. \n\u201cIn other words, when under observation, electrons are being \u201cforced\u201d to behave like particles and not like waves. Thus the mere act of observation affects the experimental findings.\u201d\nNow, I\u2019m not a scientist. But reading this makes me want to ask a few questions, like:\n\nWhat is it about the observation that changes the behavior of the electron?\nDoes this phenomenon only occur with electrons [and photons]?\nWhat if the observe is blind, does the photon still behave like a particle?\nIn other words, is it our eyes that somehow influence the way photons behave? Would a blind observer or someone present or near to the experiment, but not really paying close attention, still impact the photon the same way?\nCould it be that humans give off a low-level magnetic energy [or some other energy] that impacts the way the photons and electrons behave?\n\n\n\nNote: Those last three questions are already answered by the original article. Apparently the \u201cobserver\u201d isn\u2019t human but is \u201ca tiny yet sophisticated electronic detector that can spot passing electrons.\u201d\nStill, I wonder why observation impacts the electron. How does it know we\u2019re watching?\nScientists who study Quantum Mechanics are equally confused by these questions:\n\u201cWhen this \u201cobserver effect\u201d was first noticed by the early pioneers of quantum theory, they were deeply troubled. It seemed to undermine the basic assumption behind all science: that there is an objective world out there, irrespective of us. If the way the world behaves depends on how \u2013 or if \u2013 we look at it, what can \u201creality\u201d really mean?\n\u201cThe physicist Pascual Jordan, who worked with quantum guru Niels Bohr in Copenhagen in the 1920s, put it like this: \u201cObservations not only disturb what has to be measured, they produce it\u2026 We compel [a quantum particle] to assume a definite position.\u201d In other words, Jordan said, \u201cwe ourselves produce the results of measurements.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf that is so, objective reality seems to go out of the window.\u201d\n\u201cIf nature seems to be changing its behavior depending on whether we \u201clook\u201d or not, we could try to trick it into showing its hand. To do so, we could measure which path a particle took through the double slits, but only after it has passed through them. By then, it ought to have \u201cdecided\u201d whether to take one path or both.\n\u201cAn experiment for doing this was\xa0proposed\xa0in the 1970s by the American physicist John Wheeler, and this \u201cdelayed choice\u201d experiment\xa0was performed in the following decade.\n\u201cIt turns out that, just as Bohr confidently predicted, it makes no difference whether we delay the measurement or not. As long as we measure the photon\u2019s path before its arrival at a detector is finally registered, we lose all interference.\n\u201cIt is as if nature \u201cknows\u201d not just if we are looking, but if we are planning to look.\u201d\nSeriously. What?!\n\n\n\n\nNow, so far these experiments have only been done [as far as I know] using photons and electrons. It could be that these phenomena are only present in these elements. In other words, it\u2019s not that all of reality is this creepy, just the photon/electron family.\nBut, maybe not.\n\u201cTo this day, physicists do not agree on the best way to interpret these quantum experiments, and to some extent what you make of them is (at the moment) up to you. But one way or another, it is hard to avoid the implication that consciousness and quantum mechanics are somehow linked.\n\u201c[American physicist John] Wheeler even entertained the thought that the presence of living beings, which are capable of \u201cnoticing\u201d, has transformed what was previously a multitude of possible quantum pasts into one concrete history.\n\u201cIn this sense, Wheeler said, we become participants in the evolution of the Universe since its very beginning. In his words, we live in a \u201cparticipatory universe.\u201d\u201d\n\n\nAll of this was inspired by a comment a friend of mine made the other day. He said:\n\u201cQuantum Mechanics says all reality is a relationship between the observer and the observed.\nWithout the observer, the cosmos disappears.\u201d\nSo, after I thought about this for a moment I started to wonder if we need to be here so that the universe holds together.\nYes, where have I heard something like this before? Oh yeah:\n\u201cFor in him [Christ] all things were created:\xa0things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities;\xa0all things have been created through him and for him.\xa0He is before all things,\xa0and in him all things hold together.\xa0\u201c\nSo, Christ created all things \u2013 the known universe \u2013 and Christ holds all things together, but what if all things hold together because we are in Christ and we are observing what Christ has created?\nChrist created everything, but, without an observer, the cosmos disappears.\nNow, try to follow me here:\n\n\nChrist is in the Father, and we are in Christ, and the Father is in Christ, and in us.\n\u201cOn that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you are in Me, and I am in you.\u201d (John 14:20)\n\u201cthat all of them may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I am in You. May they also be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.\u201d (John 17:21)\n\u201cI in them and You in Me\u2013that they may be perfectly united, so that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them just as You have loved Me.\u201d (John 17:23)\nSo, Christ created all of reality. We are the creation. Yet, when we observe the creation, we make it real; we hold it all together, even as Christ does, because we are participating with Him in experiencing and observing reality.\n\u201cWe are living in a participatory universe,\u201d the Physicist said.\n\u201cIf you abide in me, I will abide in you,\u201d Jesus said. \u201cWithout me, you can do nothing, but if you remain in me you will bear much fruit.\u201d\n\n\nParticipation is essential.\nWhat do you think?\n**\nKeith Giles\u2019s new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nJOIN ME IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Sept. 15 at\xa0\u201cProactive Love: How Loving Our Enemies Changes Everything\u201d.\xa0Register HERE>\nI also co-host the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean and I live in Orange, CA with my wife of 28 years and our two sons.\nBONUS: Unlock exclusive content including unique blog articles, short stories, free music, podcasts, videos and more on my\xa0Patreon page.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/08/reality_created_by_observation/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian

117,The Unbelievable Truth: God Lives Within Me,"July 31, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nPart 4 in the Unbelievable Truth Series\nThere is an incredible reality to be discovered in the Gospel. One that should revolutionize the life, boggle the mind, and transform the behavior of every single Christian who fully perceives it. However, the sad thing is that, while many Christians are aware of this reality in theory, they mostly live lives that effectively deny it on a daily basis.\n\n\nThe reality? Simply that God lives within every single person who has placed their trust in Jesus as Lord and Messiah.\nThink of it. God, the Creator of the Universe, the Great I Am, the Alpha and the Omega, actually lives within you. Not just when you\u2019re praying. Not just when you\u2019re at Church. Not just when you\u2019re doing something Holy or Spiritual, but all the time.\nIf we really took this truth to heart, it would radically transform our daily routine. Unfortunately, we behave as if this essential element of the Gospel isn\u2019t actually true. We behave as if it\u2019s a metaphor, but not as if the very same presence of the Holy One that used to hover over the Ark of the Covenant in the Jewish Temple is actually residing within our ribcage.\nNow, I can go through a fairly extensive list of scriptures right now to prove this reality, but if you don\u2019t already accept this as an actuality, it will only support this idea in theory, not enhance your reality.\nAs God Himself alluded early on,\xa0\u201cHeaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where will my resting place be?\u201d (Isaiah 66:1)\n\n\nWhen King David wanted to answer that question personally by building a house for God, he was told that God would be the one to build Himself an acceptable dwelling place. The one who would accomplish this was the promised Messiah.\nBut the problem is, when Jesus arrived there was already a very large Temple standing in the center of Jerusalem. So, what Temple did Jesus build? He built the acceptable house \u201cnot made with human hands\u201d that is \u201cmade of living stones\u201d \u2013 the Church.\nAnd who is The Church? We are. Those who follow Jesus are the living temple of God.\nThis means that we are His resting place. We are the house that God has built for Himself.\n\u201cI write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.\u201d (1 Timothy 3:15)\nSo, this is more than hyperbole. This is not a nice metaphor. This is reality. God abandoned the physical Jewish Temple in Jerusalem the very moment that Jesus fulfilled the promise by offering himself as the Lamb of God as the High Priest of God in the Temple of His Body when he died on the cross.\n\n\nNext, God tore the veil in the Temple to emphasize that He would no longer reside behind that veil or hover over the Ark of the Covenant, as He foretold through the prophet Jeremiah:\n\u201cIn those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land,\u201d declares the LORD, \u201cmen will no longer say, \u2018The ark of the covenant of the LORD.\u2019 It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made.\u201d (Jeremiah 3:16)\nWhere would He reside from now on? Within the heart of every single member of the Body of Christ.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that you yourselves are God\u2019s temple and that God\u2019s Spirit dwells in your midst?\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:16)\nOver and over again in the New Testament, Jesus and the Apostles affirm the glorious truth \u2013 God has come to live in the hearts and lives of every man, woman, and child who loves Him.\n\n\nIn fact, this is what the New Covenant (or New Testament) is all about!\xa0\u201cThe days are coming,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cwhen I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.\u201d (Jeremiah 31:31)\n\n\nAnd what was this New Covenant all about?\n\u201cThis is the (new) covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,\u201d declares the Lord. \u201cI will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, \u2018Know the Lord,\u2019 because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,\u201d declares the Lord.\u201d\xa0\xa0(Jeremiah 31:33-34)\nSee how amazing this is? If you have surrendered your life to Christ, God is actually alive within you right now.\nThis means that you and I cannot ever escape God\u2019s presence. He is with us this very moment. In fact, one of the names of the Messiah was \u201cEmmanuel\u201d which means \u201cGod with us\u201d so it should come as no surprise really.\nGod\u2019s greatest desire is to make His home in your heart. He wants His thoughts to be your thoughts. He wants your desires to be His desires. He wants to make you His Bride, which as Paul expresses is a \u201cProfound Mystery\u201d for the ages.\nWhat\u2019s sad is that we don\u2019t really believe this is true. We read the words and we say \u201camen\u201d at the concept, but in actual point of fact we just don\u2019t buy it.\n\n\nBut just imagine for a moment if we did believe it. How would this awesome truth change your attitude, affect your behavior, influence your actions?\nIf you were fully convinced that every breath and heartbeat was inhabited with the actual Holy presence of the Creator of the Universe, you\u2019d probably love people more, have more patience, treat people with more respect, trust God with your anxieties and fears more, and be more careful about the things you said out loud \u2013 and the things you muttered under your breath.\nI\u2019m not sure about you, but I think it would be a much better world if we all really believed that God was alive within us every moment of every day.\nWhat do you think?\n**\nKeith Giles\u2019s new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nJOIN ME IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Sept. 15 at\xa0\u201cProactive Love: How Loving Our Enemies Changes Everything\u201d.\xa0Register HERE>\nI also co-host the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean and I live in Orange, CA with my wife of 28 years and our two sons.\nBONUS: Unlock exclusive content including unique blog articles, short stories, free music, podcasts, videos and more on my\xa0Patreon page.\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/07/the-unbelievable-truth-god-lives-within-me/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
118,The Unbelievable Truth: God Is Trustworthy,"July 30, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nPart 3 in the Unbelievable Truth series.\nImage: Pixabay\nOne of the hardest truths for Christians to accept is the idea that God is trustworthy. They can believe in Him \u2013 that He exists and that He created the Universe \u2013 but to surrender control of their lives to Him? Not so much.\n\n\nTo me this is the most tragic of all the unbelievable truths, because if we cannot trust God then who can we trust?Our inability to trust God, I think, says more about our need to be in control, or our fear of relinquishing control, than it does about our belief that God isn\u2019t worthy of our trust.In other words, if we think about it, God is the most trustworthy being in the Universe. He created us. He laid aside His power to become one of us. He allowed us to have power over Him. He forgave us as we were killing Him. He loved us enough to die in our place. He rose again to ensure that we could spend eternity together. He\u2019s preparing a place for us to be with Him forever. So, how could we ever consider someone like this to be unworthy of our trust?I think it has to be because we just prefer to be the ones in control of our lives. We don\u2019t like the idea of letting go of the steering wheel for anyone else, not even a God who went as far as this to demonstrate His complete and utter trustworthiness. Which is sad.If we could actually believe this truth that God is trustworthy, and prove it by surrendering our lives to Him, then we\u2019d experience all the sweet joys and wonderful blessings that He intends to share with us. We would rest in Him and trust that He has everything under complete control.\xa0\xa0We would experience the sweet peace that only comes from allowing this loving Father to take us with Him on an amazing adventure of life that He has planned in advance for us to follow.A person who truly trusted God with everything in their life would have no worries about tomorrow, no stress about finances, no concern for what will happen next, and have nothing but complete peace and joy on a daily basis. Much the same was how we imagine winning the lottery might make us feel, actually. Except that those who win the lottery seldom find actual peace and those who are wealthy and famous have just as much (if not more) angst and pain and worry in their lives.\xa0\n\n\nIf we believed that God was trustworthy we could obey Jesus when He says that we should \u201cnot worry about tomorrow\u201d or about \u201cwhat we will eat or drink, or about our body and what we will wear\u201d but simply trust that \u201cYour Heavenly Father knows that you need these things\u201d and let go of our worry in order to \u201cseek first the Kingdom of God\u201d.\n\n\nIf only we could trust God with everything. If only we really believed that He was trustworthy.If only.\n**\nKeith Giles\u2019s new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nJOIN ME IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Sept. 15 at\xa0\u201cProactive Love: How Loving Our Enemies Changes Everything\u201d.\xa0Register HERE>\n\n\nI also co-host the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean and I live in Orange, CA with my wife of 28 years and our two sons.\nBONUS: Unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more on my\xa0Patreon page.\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/07/the-unbelievable-truth-god-is-trustworthy/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
119,The Unbelievable Truth: Jesus Was Fully Human,"July 27, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nPart 2 in the Unbelievable Truth Series. Read Part 1 HERE\n\n\nWhen we think of Jesus we usually imagine him as the God-man who was perfect in every way. We don\u2019t tend to think of him the way the disciples thought of him \u2013 as a man who walked with them, talked with them, ate with them, slept alongside them and occasionally kept them awake with his snoring.\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Jesus was by nature divine, we also are told that Jesus was \u201cmade flesh\u201d and that he humbled himself to become one of us. What\u2019s more, Jesus affirmed to us when he was here in the flesh that he was just as powerless as you and I are now.\nJesus also affirms that he does nothing under his own power, nor does he teach anything apart from what the Father tells him to.\nSee for yourself:\n\u201cThen Jesus answered them and said, \u201cTruly, truly, I say to you;\xa0the Son can do nothing of himself, but only does what he sees the Father do.\xa0For whatever things he [the Father] does, these are also likewise done by the Son.\u201d (John 5:19)\n\u201cOf my own self, I can do nothing.\xa0I judge only as I hear; and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the Father who has sent me.\u201d (John 5:30)\nJesus also affirms that the great words of wisdom and truth that he spoke were not his own words, but that he was hearing them from His Father:\n\n\n\u201cThese words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.\u201d (John 14:24)\n\u201cFor I do not speak of myself, but from the Father who sent me and commanded me what I should say and what I should speak. And I know that to obey his command is life everlasting. Therefore,\xa0whatever I speak is just as the Father tells me to speak.\u201d (John 12:49-50)\n\u201cBut so that the world may know that I love the Father,\xa0I only do exactly as the Father has instructed me to do.\u201d (John 14:31)\nThe point seems to be that Jesus lived a life of humility and surrender. It\u2019s clear that Jesus didn\u2019t live out a perfect life on Earth out of any power of his own. Actually, according to the New Testament, Jesus let go of all of his power when he came in the flesh.\nWhat this means is that we cannot say, \u201cI\u2019m not like Jesus so don\u2019t expect me to live the way he lived.\u201d On the contrary, it was because Jesus emptied himself of his glory and power and took on flesh to become nothing that he was capable of doing what he did:\n\n\n\u201cIn your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather,\xa0he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.\xa0And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death \u2014 even death on a cross!\u201d (Philippians 2:5-8)\nPlus, the New Testament writers also told us that those who claim to be Christians must behave like Jesus:\n\n\n\u201cWhoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.\u201d (1 John 2:6)\nThis is precisely why most Christians do not believe that Jesus was fully human during his life on this Earth. If Jesus could do those things as a mere human who was fully surrendered to the Spirit of God, then the implication is that we should all be capable of living such an others-focused life. But, of course, that\u2019s exactly what the New Testament does teach us.\nIt\u2019s why Jesus tells his disciples:\n\n\n\u201cVery truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.\u201d (John 14:12)\nThe whole point is that we can do what Jesus did because he was like us; fully human.\nIf Christians today actually believed the truth about the humanity of Jesus, then they might actually take his call to follow him seriously. We might actually start realizing that it is actually possible for us to love our enemies, and pray for those who hate us, and turn the other cheek, and serve the poor, and everything else that Jesus commanded us to do.\nSadly, it\u2019s so much easier to elevate Jesus into a state of unapproachable holiness so that our ability to reach such heights of perfection is forever out of reach.\nBut, just imagine if we really did believe this amazing truth? Wouldn\u2019t our churches be filled with people who were more humble and totally dependent upon God daily for the grace necessary to live a life of service? Wouldn\u2019t the poor and the prostitutes and the orphans rejoice that the world was filled with people who took the pattern set by Jesus and truly lived out his example of radical, sacrificial love?\n\n\nI can\u2019t help but believe that this is exactly the sort of thing that Jesus intended us to do. It\u2019s certainly what his disciples did after his ascension. It\u2019s certainly what the early church did for hundreds of years. Why not now? Why not you and I?\nCOMING NEXT: Part 3 \u2013 \u201cGod Can Be Trusted\u201d\nREAD PART 1: \u201cGod Really Does Love You\u201d\n**\nKeith Giles\u2019s new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nJOIN ME IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Sept. 15 at\xa0\u201cProactive Love: How Loving Our Enemies Changes Everything\u201d.\xa0Register HERE>\n\n\nI also co-host the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean and I live in Orange, CA with my wife of 28 years and our two sons.\nBONUS: Unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more on my\xa0Patreon page.\n\xa0\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/07/the-unbelievable-truth-jesus-was-fully-human/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
120,The Unbelievable Truth: God Really Does Love You,"July 26, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nNOTE: I\u2019ll be publishing a series of articles to examine ideas that most Christians should believe, but just can\u2019t seem to fully embrace. \n\n\nUnbelievable Truth #1: God Really Loves You\n\n\nGod\u2019s love for mankind is an incredible thing. The idea that God, who knows the end from the beginning, would know in advance how much pain and suffering He would have to personally endure as the result of creating the Universe and yet still say the words, \u201cLet there be light\u201d is staggering.\nThe scriptures are replete with example after example of God\u2019s endless declarations of love for every single person on the planet. Usually these statements are about nations, or about general populations of people, but Jesus goes even further with this idea and affirms that God actually loves each of us individually. This is why Jesus urges us to call God our \u201cAbba\u201d or \u201cDaddy\u201d when we pray. It\u2019s why Jesus says that God loved the world (and that means everyone in the world, and therefore you and me) so much that He sent Jesus to give us life and set us free.\nPaul the Apostle encouraged all of us to meditate on God\u2019s incredible love:\n\u201c I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord\u2019s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge\u2014that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.\u201d (Ephesians 3:17-19)\n\n\nGod\u2019s love is wider than we can imagine. It\u2019s longer than we can comprehend. It\u2019s higher than we can reach. It\u2019s deeper than we can fathom. God\u2019s love surpasses knowledge. This means it\u2019s beyond knowing. It\u2019s too great for us to wrap our minds around. It means that if you had all the knowledge in the Universe you\u2019d still not be capable of fully knowing God\u2019s amazing love.\nGod made you in His own image. Just think of how that makes Him feel every time He looks at you. [Genesis 1:27]\nHis thoughts about you are more numerous than all the grains of sand on all the beaches on this planet. He is actually thinking about you. Right now. [Psalm 139:17-18]\nGod has plans for your life. They are good plans. Plans to bless you and not to curse you. Plans to give you a future and fill you with hope. [Jeremiah 29:11]\nGod is singing over you. Right now. Just try to imagine what His voice sounds like as He opens His mouth and sings a song of love about you. [Zeph. 3:17]\nGod loves you so much that He would rather die than live without you. How amazing is that? [John 3:16]\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing more amazing than God\u2019s awesome love? The fact that you and I can take it for granted, or worse, not fully receive it.\nMost Christians don\u2019t really go through their lives with the awareness of God\u2019s astounding love in their hearts. They walk around looking tired, or feeling bored, or stressed out; totally oblivious to the endless showers of love that God is pouring down over them night and day.\nI think I understand\xa0why\xa0we don\u2019t believe that God loves us like this. It\u2019s because deep down inside we\u2019re convinced that we don\u2019t deserve that kind of love, and certainly not from someone as Holy and Perfect as God. But that\u2019s the whole point of God\u2019s love \u2013 we don\u2019t deserve it and yet He pours it all over us because of who He is, not because of who we are.\nJust imagine if Christians really did believe that God loved them? Wouldn\u2019t they be happier? Wouldn\u2019t this love fill them up and spill out of them like light from under a basket? Wouldn\u2019t a greater awareness of God\u2019s unconditional, endless, boundless and fantastic love change them forever? Wouldn\u2019t this love help them to love others more? Wouldn\u2019t this love make it easier to forgive those who hurt them most? Wouldn\u2019t this love transform their hearts, and their minds, and transform them from the inside out?\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\n*Can you think of a truth that Christians don\u2019t actually believe in practice?

121,Why Is Love So Mysterious?,"July 25, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nThe other day I posted a link to my article \u201cWhy Do Christians Deny The Power Of Love?\u201d and someone responded by asking me this:\n\u201cHi\xa0Keith, if you are willing, I\u2019d like to go deeper into what you said in this article because I would like to understand where you are coming from. There were a few things you implied and I\u2019m not familiar with what you are trying to say. Can you tell\xa0me how you are defining love in your article? It almost seems in your article that love is bigger than God because everything is about love and is subservient to love or love\u2019s bigger picture. Is this what you meant?\u201d\n\n\nSo, to clarify I responded with:\n\u201cLove can\u2019t be bigger than God because God IS love.\xa0\n\u201cAnd why don\u2019t you know what love is? I think that should be obvious to us, if we have been loved by LOVE then we should have a pretty good frame of reference.\n\u201c\u2018Love one another as I have loved you,\u201d Jesus said. So\u2026.how has He loved you? Make a list. Now, start to love others in that very same way.\n\u201cFor some hints, we can also refer to 1 Cor. 13.\u201d\n\xa0\nThinking that had done the trick I moved on, but then today this same person said:\n\u201cThanks for the reply! I\u2019m afraid I am still a little bit confused. Are you saying that however I feel love and think that Jesus has loved me actually is love? This seems to make love relative to each person because how I perceive love may not be how you perceive love. Or are you saying that I Cor. 13 is the standard that all of us must filter our experiences through?\u201d\n\n\nSo, I can see this person is still confused \u2013 and this confuses ME. Why are people who are created by love, saved by love, transformed by love and commanded to love others as they have been loved, so completely befuddled by LOVE?\nMy response to her was this:\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t love be a Christian\u2019s new language? How can we be confused about what love is, and what love looks like? Aren\u2019t we experiencing this unending, inseparable, unchanging, transformative love every single moment of every single day that we are in Christ?\nWhy is love such a mystery?\xa0\nHere\u2019s one way to know if you\u2019re loving people the way Jesus commanded: If they feel loved, then you\u2019re doing it right. If they don\u2019t feel loved, keep trying.\u201d\nEarlier this morning I saw a comment on another thread where a different person was questioning one of my posts about following Jesus into nonviolence.\nMy post was this:\n\u201cIf you pledge your life to obey a person who says we should love our enemies, you might not want to join another group that requires you to disobey those commands by using violence to kill other people.\u201d\n\n\nIn response, one person said:\n\u201cI have to agree with CS Lewis on this one, if you are speaking of military or police or protecting one\u2019s family or others. If police respond to an active shooter and he is killed that to me is a lot of nonviolence simply because violence was stopped.\xa0Would it be better if they, the police manage to stop him without him being killed? Most likely as long as he\u2019s kept away from society. But I don\u2019t think nonviolence is as simple as is not joining military or police sometimes it\u2019s the most nonviolent thing for good people to do, one certainly doesn\u2019t want bad people in those positions and there, unfortunately, is some. They are there to make us safer.\u201d\nMy response to her was:\n\u201cAre you suggesting that \u201cNonviolence\u201d is when we kill someone to stop them from doing violence? Is that your definition? Is that what you think Jesus means when he tells us not to resist an evil person but to turn the other cheek and\xa0to love our enemies?\n\u201cTo me, it IS so simple. Jesus gave us \u2013 His followers \u2013 very clear commands about how we are to react to those who intend to do us harm \u2013 we are to love them, bless them, do good to them, turn the other cheek, and put down our weapons. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo of the most powerful things Jesus said were:\n\u201cMy Kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my disciples would fight.\u201d\nand..\n\u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord, Lord\u2019 if you do not do what I say?\u201d\n[and this was said directly after his Sermon on the Mount where he commanded us to respond to violence with love].\n\u201cI understand that this is confusing to us, especially when all our lives we have lived under a different way of thinking.\n\u201cThis is why Jesus begins his Sermon on the Mount by saying: \u201cRepent!\u201d which literally means \u201cThink differently!\u201d, because he knows these ideas are not natural to us.\xa0\n\u201cSpiritual things must be spiritually discerned.\u201d\nThen she responded to this by saying:\n\u201cThe urge to protect is God-given. I could cite verses on protecting the orphan, the widow, the refugee, the oppressed, but I won\u2019t. God gives us the natural urge to protect to go against that is not like Him nor human. He gave us human reaction for a reason.\u201d\n\n\nAnd all I could say was:\n\u201cYes, but protection need not be deadly or violent. Have you ever protected anyone? Where did you bury the bodies? \U0001f642\xa0\u201c\nNow, I do understand that the words of Jesus are not easy to accept. I think we DO understand Him, but we just can\u2019t process it. We can\u2019t make it fit our paradigm. So, we try to force it in there, we try to make it fit. But it doesn\u2019t fit. It supersedes our logic and obliterates our reasoning.\nWe say, \u201cIf we don\u2019t fight, we will die.\u201d\nBut Jesus says, \u201cIf you continue to fight, you will be destroyed. Try something totally different. Not violence, but love. Not force, but kindness. We do not overcome evil with evil. We overcome evil with good.\u201d\nCan we accept this? Can we really believe in love? Can we really surrender ourselves to nonviolence and trust that Jesus knows what he\u2019s talking about?\nFor thousands of years we\u2019ve been trying it one way: Responding to violence with more violence. This is insanity: Doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. The only thing we have yet to try, in any real way, is to love one another as Christ has loved us.\n\n\nI think it\u2019s worth a shot.\nEDIT: After I posted this article here, one of my friends, (Epaphras Dove), responded to the comment about nonviolence beautifully by saying:\n\u201cThe idea that \u201csometimes violence is necessary\u201d stems from \n1. Not believing God and \n2. Being unimaginative.\xa0\nMost situations have nonviolent solutions, but it takes intentionality and practice to accomplish them. If we never think about or practice other ways of responding to threats when the time arises we\u2019ll be at a loss of what to do because the world offers violence as the only solution.\xa0\n\nDo we offer the lame platitude \u201csometimes violence is necessary\u201d for other things that go against what Jesus has taught us?\n\nCan you imagine saying, \u201csometimes infidelity is necessary, after all God put within us the desire to procreate and commanded us to be fruitful and multiply\u201d?\n\nNo, that would be ridiculous.\u201d\nBravo.\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nJOIN ME IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Sept. 15 at\xa0\u201cProactive Love: How Loving Our Enemies Changes Everything\u201d.\xa0Register HERE>\nI also co-host the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean and I live in Orange, CA with my wife of 28 years and our two sons.\nBONUS: Unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more on my\xa0Patreon page.\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/07/why-is-love-so-mysterious/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
122,Everything We Need To Live Like Christ,"July 19, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\u201cHis divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us\u2026.He has given us His very great and precious promises so that through them you may participate in the Divine nature.\u201d\xa0(2 Peter 1:3-4)\nWhat\u2019s holding you back from living like Jesus today? Is it your sin nature? Is it your addictions, or your temptations, or your brokenness?\n\n\nIs this why you don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s possible to actually put the words of Jesus into practice? Is this why you hardly ever attempt to love your enemy, or to forgive those who have hurt you, or to turn the other cheek whenever you\u2019re insulted?\nDo you read things like \u201cBe holy even as your heavenly Father is holy\u201d and just say, \u201cYeah, right!\u201d?\nDo you doubt completely the idea that anyone could ever actually walk like Jesus did?\nIf so, you are not alone. Most Christians I\u2019ve met are in the exact same place. They fully and aggressively deny that anyone could ever do the things that Jesus did, or love like Him, or live a life in the here and now that is marked by holiness and humility and sincere compassion for others.\nIt just can\u2019t be done!\nHe was Jesus and I\u2019m an imperfect sinner!\nI\u2019m broken!\nI\u2019m a worm!\nLet\u2019s sing those songs we all love about how God\u2019s Amazing Grace has \u201csaved a wretch like me\u201d or how we are all \u201c\u2026prone to wander\u201d (Lord I feel it!)\nA Christianity like this loudly proclaims that the death of Christ on the cross was only capable of providing me with a ticket to heaven, but it was not nearly powerful enough to transform my life into one that resembles His own.\n\n\nThe real trouble with this sort of Christianity is that it can\u2019t be found anywhere in the New Testament.\nNope. I\u2019ve checked. It\u2019s not in there.\nWhat we do read about is how God\u2019s Amazing Grace has not only saved us, it\u2019s gone on to do something most of us doubt could ever be true: Saved us \u2013 AND \u2013 empowered us to live a holy life like Jesus did!\n\u201cFor the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men\u2026\u201d\xa0(Titus 2:11)\nYep, there\u2019s the salvation part, but look at what he says next:\n\u201c\u2026instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age\u2026\u201d (Titus 2:12)\nSee that? Grace not only brings salvation to all men, it then goes on to \u201cinstruct us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live sensibly, righteously and godly \u2013 IN THE PRESENT AGE.\u201d\nBut wait, that\u2019s not all!\n\u201cThis is how we know we are in him: Whoever claims to be in him must walk as Jesus did.\u201d (1 John 2:5)\nYowza!\nAre you in Christ? If we claim to be in Christ we must do one thing: \u201clive as Jesus did\u201d!\n\n\n\n\nHow can we do that? Isn\u2019t that impossible?\nAlone, yes, it is impossible. We can\u2019t even come close to obeying the words of Jesus apart from His indwelling presence in our daily lives.\nThat\u2019s why Jesus said: \u201cApart from me you can do nothing.\u201d (John 15:5)\nBut what if we abide in Him? What if He abides in us? Then, and only then, can we \u201cbear much fruit.\u201d (John 15:5)\nThis is why Jesus can promise us that his yoke is easy and his burden is light even as he calls us to do things that seem impossible, like love our enemies and forgive those who hurt us, and turn the other cheek.\nHow can Jesus say that?

123,Why Do Christians Deny the Power of Love?,"July 19, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pexels\nWhen it comes to love, many Christians have a pretty low opinion of it. Sure, it\u2019s great. But there\u2019s so much more they would rather focus on. Things like Justice and Wrath, and Sovereignty and Judgment, for example, are much more important to them than love.\n\n\nTo Christians like this, the Gospel is more about escaping the eternal flames of hell than it is about knowing a God who loves us enough to lay down His life for the world.\nI\u2019ve actually had Christians leave our house church fellowship because we \u201cspend too much time talking about love.\u201d [Seriously]. One man recently left me a long voicemail message about how he was leaving our group because we only wanted to focus on God\u2019s love. He then went on to suggest that God\u2019s love is also about punishing sinners who stray from His law.\nThis is not an isolated case. Truth be told, many Christians are offended by this continual focus on love. They don\u2019t want to sing about it. They don\u2019t want to meditate on it. They don\u2019t want to believe that God\u2019s love is the most important thing.\nTo them, love is a squishy, mushy, mamby-pamby syrup that is best taken in small doses.\nWhat\u2019s more, they tend to see love as a sign of weakness and connect it to what they term as an \u201cover-emphasis on emotions.\u201d What they want is to spend more time on doctrines, and to focus on the \u201cWord of God\u201d which, in their terminology, is code for \u201cThe Holy Bible\u201d, not what the Bible says it is, which is Jesus.\n\n\nI started to reflect on this phenomenon recently. I wondered why so many Christians today seem to undervalue the love of God. Why do they see it as being synonymous with weakness and human emotion?\nI want to ask them: \u201cIs God weak?\u201d Of course not. God is the most powerful being in the Universe. I mean, heck, God created the Universe and holds everything in it together. Of course God is powerful.\nYet, God is love. So, if God is love, then how can love be weak or powerless?\nAnother question I\u2019d like to ask is: \u201cWhy would a Christian trust in any other power?\u201d Most Christians who guffaw at the power of love tend to favor the power of physical weapons. They trust in guns, or the State, to protect them. They would rather have their faith in the power to inflict death on others than to trust in the power of God\u2019s love to transform from within.\nUnderstand something: The power of a gun is rooted in the power of fear and death. The power of intimidation is tied to use of force and the threat of violence.\nBut don\u2019t we know that God\u2019s perfect love casts out fear? Do we really believe that? Maybe not. But if we do believe that love renders fear powerless, then we must admit that all weapons are useless.\n\n\n\n\nNow, those who properly wield the power of love are more powerful than those who brandish weapons of fear and death. However, like anyone else, we need to learn how to use our weapons skillfully in order to be effective.\nNo one can just buy a machine gun or a high-powered sniper rifle and expect to be an expert marksman without any training. No one can purchase a katana or a compound bow and become proficient with these weapons without years of practice and hours of instruction.\nLearning to use the power of love is no exception. If we want to learn how to use the most powerful force in the Universe effectively, it will take an entire lifetime to hone our skills and see results.\nThis is why we need to spend hours together focused on the love of God.\nGod is love. There is nothing stronger.\nNo power in heaven above or hell below is greater than pure love.\nLove disarms us. Love transforms us. Love overcomes hate. Love defies the grave.\nLove is wider, higher, longer and deeper than anything we can comprehend.\nWe cannot ever be separated from this love. Nothing can ever take it from us. It is eternally embedded within every person\u2019s heart who abides in Christ.\n\n\nAll human power is based on fear and death. God\u2019s love is the ultimate power that erases fear and conquers death.\nSo, like it or not, anyone who chooses the power of death and fear has already lost the war.\nLove is the greatest power in the Universe. Love created the Universe. Love sustains the Universe.\nWithout love we are nothing.\nAnd the greatest thing about love is that love never fails.\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nJOIN ME IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Sept. 15 at\xa0\u201cProactive Love: How Loving Our Enemies Changes Everything\u201d.\xa0Register HERE>\nI also co-host the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean and I live in Orange, CA with my wife of 28 years and our two sons.\n\n\nBONUS: Unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more on my\xa0Patreon page.\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/07/why-do-christians-deny-the-power-of-love/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
124,Dear Megaphone Street Preacher,"July 16, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nJust once I\u2019d love to hear you\xa0 take your megaphone and\xa0stand up in front of the bar, or outside the rock concert and say something like this:\n\u201cListen to me, oh people! The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! God does not live in a church!\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. That means, God doesn\u2019t require you and I to do stuff in order to please Him. Instead, God himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else!\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! God is the one who is serving and blessing us!\n\u201cFrom one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.\n\u201cThis means we are all related! We\u2019re family! We\u2019re all brothers and sisters!\n\u201cGod did all of this so that we might search for him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! God wants to be found! He is not far away. God is not hiding from us. There are no gatekeepers. God is available and accessible to everyone!\n\u201cAs it says, \u2018For in God we all live and move and have our being.\u2019 and\u2026 \u2018We are all God\u2019s children!\u2019\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! You and I can call God \u201cDad,\u201d or \u201cPapa.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore since we are God\u2019s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone\u2014an image made by human design and skill.\n\n\n\u201cGod is like us. God is alive. God has feelings. God has taken on flesh in the person of Jesus to show us how to be like God, and how to be human.\n\u201cIn the past God overlooked such ignorance. In fact, God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself and not counting anyone\u2019s sins against them. That\u2019s not who God is! That\u2019s not what God is like. \u201cLove keeps no record of wrongs!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut now God invites all people everywhere to think differently about everything: God, spirituality, life, forgiveness and love.\n\u201cGod will make everything right again. God is working towards Justice and He invites us to join Him in this beautiful work of the Kingdom, reconciling all people to Himself because of His great love for everyone!\n\u201cYou say, \u2018This seems too good to be true!\u201d or maybe you wonder, \u201cWhat\u2019s the proof that any of this is true?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great response! God invites you to look into this. Jesus is alive today! We can know God through Christ and the proof of all of this is that Christ is alive today and you and I can experience God right here and now!\n\n\n\u201cSo, who\u2019s interested in learning more about Jesus and the great and marvelous God of love who would rather die than live without you?\u201d\n[A little remix of Paul\u2019s sermon to the pagan, idol-worshippers in Athens as recorded in Acts 17:16-34; with some additional flavor from his message in 1 Cor. 13 and 2 Cor. 5:19.]\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nJOIN ME IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Sept. 15 at\xa0\u201cProactive Love: How Loving Our Enemies Changes Everything\u201d.\xa0Register HERE>\nI also co-host the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean and I live in Orange, CA with my wife of 28 years and our two sons.\n\n\nBONUS: Unlock exclusive content including blog articles, short stories, music, podcasts, videos and more on my\xa0Patreon page.\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/07/dear-megaphone-street-preacher/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
125,Abandon Your Quiet Time If You Want To Hear God,"July 13, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nFor years I was told by my pastors, my Sunday School teachers and my mentors that I needed to have a dedicated Quiet Time with God if I wanted to grow as a Christian and learn to hear God\u2019s voice.\nAnd I believed it.\nSo, I used to schedule time every morning to spend with God. For the first few days, maybe even a week, I\u2019d wake up early, pour some coffee, sit down on the sofa with my Bible and a Journal, and put in my 30 minutes of \u201cGod Time.\u201d\n\n\nIt never worked.\nFor the first few days it was fine. I felt spiritual. I sensed God\u2019s approval. Here I was, the good boy, giving up an extra half hour of sleep to suffer through a Daily Bread devotional, or a chapter of the Psalms, and jot down a few profound observations in my journal. Spiritual maturity, here I come!\nBut then reality set in. Inevitably I\u2019d sleep in one morning, promise myself to spend an hour the next day, and then skip that day too.\nThe end result was, I\u2019d feel like a loser and heap all sorts of guilt upon myself. The only scripture that would come to my mind was \u201cCould you not tarry with me one hour?\u201d and eventually I\u2019d just give up and go back to life as usual.\nBut, what if that\u2019s the whole point? I mean, why do we think that God only wants 30 minutes of our day? Why do we feel like God requires this artificial corner of space and time where we interact with Him?\nHonestly, I think this Quiet Time mentality creates the opposite of the intended effect. Instead of drawing us nearer to God, I think it allows us to put God into a box where we engage with Him on our terms, when it\u2019s most convenient to us, and it prevents us from recognizing that God is alive within us and never leaves us or forsakes us \u2013 ever!\n\n\n\n\nSo, nowadays, I tend to take God everywhere I go. He\u2019s not sitting on my sofa wondering when I\u2019ll return to spend a few scattered minutes with Him. He\u2019s alive in my heart and as close to me as my own breath; as near as my own heartbeat.\nMy time with God is at work, in the car, at the grocery store, in the elevator, in the waiting room, at the party, watching the movie, eating ice cream alone at 2am, etc.\nThis is what God has always wanted: All of us, all of the time.\nThis is also what God has given to us in advance: All of Himself, all of the time.\nDon\u2019t try to squeeze the infinite into a square on your calendar, or that corner of your sofa. God is always with us. Learn to listen to God\u2019s voice every moment of every day. Ask God what work is being done in the lives of people you encounter every day and allow God to invite you into that.\nWe have been given fullness in Christ. Let\u2019s start living that way.\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nJOIN ME IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Sept. 15 at \u201cProactive Love: How Loving Our Enemies Changes Everything\u201d.

126,3 Scriptures That Just Keep Blowing My Mind,"July 12, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nOver the last few months, I\u2019ve run across 3 scripture verses that are seriously melting my brain. (In a very good way.)\nThe first one is this:\n\u201c15\xa0The Son is the image\xa0of the invisible God,\xa0the firstborn\xa0over all creation.\xa016\xa0For in him all things were created:\xa0things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities;\xa0all things have been created through him and for him.\xa017\xa0He is before all things,\xa0and in him all things hold together.\xa018\xa0And he is the head\xa0of the body, the church;\xa0he is the beginning and the firstborn\xa0from among the dead,\xa0so that in everything he might have the supremacy.19\xa0For God was pleased\xa0to have all his fullness\xa0dwell in him,\xa020\xa0and through him to reconcile\xa0to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven,\xa0by making peace\xa0through his blood,\xa0shed on the cross.\u201d \u2013 Col. 1:15-20\n\n\nFirst, we notice that Jesus is \u201cthe image of the invisible God\u201d; something I\u2019ve done a lot of writing and thinking about lately. But, the second part is almost unbearably amazing: \u201cGod was pleased to have all his\xa0fullness dwell in him.\u201d\nNow, you need to hang on to that concept long enough to read the second verse:\n\u201c9\xa0For in Christ all the fullness\xa0of the Deity lives in bodily form,\xa010\xa0and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head\xa0over every power and authority. \u201c \u2013 Col. 2:9-10\nThere it is again: Christ embodies all fullness of God,\xa0but it\u2019s the next part that knocks me backward: \u201c\u2026and in Christ, you have been brought to fullness.\u201d\nAre you ready for the next part? Here it is:\n\u201c\xa022And God placed all things under his [Christ\u2019s] feet\xa0and appointed him to be head\xa0over everything for the church,23\xa0which is his body,\xa0the fullness of him\xa0who fills everything in every way.\u201d \u2013 Eph. 1:22-23\n\n\nThis one might be a bit harder to notice because of the way Paul composes his thoughts, but essentially this verse says:\nGod placed everything under Christ\u2019s feet. \nChrist is the head over everything for the Church.\nThe Church is His Body.\nThe Church is the fullness of Christ.\nChrist fills everything in every way.\nSo\u2026if we put all 3 of these verses together we get something like this:\n\n\nChrist embodies the fullness of God.\nWe, in Christ, are brought to that same fullness.\nChrist, who fills everything in every way, fills us with His fullness.\nWhat does this mean? I think it means more things than I have the capacity to express in words.\nChrist is not merely the \u201cimage of God.\u201d Christ is filled with the entire fullness of God.\nNot only this: But the entire fullness of God is contained \u201cin bodily form.\u201d\nDoes that make any sense? The Infinite is contained within a finite human body?\nWell, that is what it says. Then we learn that we are now Christ\u2019s body and that we are now \u201cbrought to fullness\u201d and\xa0 we are \u201cthe fullness of Him who fills everything in every way.\u201d\n\n\nWhat?!\nFirst, the fullness of God was contained in Christ\u2019s body. Now, we are Christ\u2019s body. That means that all the fullness of God STILL lives in bodily form today. Where? In us!\nNot a little bit. Not a residue of the Divine. We are talking the FULLNESS of God, alive in us; in bodily form!\nAm I the only one who gets geeked out by this? Hello? Anyone?\nGod. Alive. In me. Right now. The same way God was alive in Christ. The total, one hundred percent, absolute freakin\u2019 FULLNESS OF THE LIVING GOD [excuse me]\u2026.alive in me, and you!\nI could meditate on this for the rest of my life. I think I just might.\nIf this amazes you, please let me know in the comments below.\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

127,How To Know When America Becomes A Fascist State,"July 10, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nAs the American Empire begins its slow decline, here\u2019s a handy checklist to help you determine when you are officially living in a Fascist State:\nDoes your Government spy on your\xa0phone calls,\xa0email,\xa0and\xa0text communications?\n\n\nDoes your Government\xa0execute its own citizens without a trial or even formal criminal charges?\nDoes your Government\xa0imprison journalists who attempt to expose their war crimes?\xa0\nDoes your nation\xa0currently imprison more of its citizens than any other nation on the face of the planet? \nAre your local police\xa0carrying automatic weapons,\xa0driving armored military vehicles\xa0and indiscriminately\xa0killing innocent,\xa0unarmed people on a daily basis?\n\n\nIs your Government\xa0one of the largest military forces on the planet?\nDoes your Government\xa0spend more on the military than the other 8 largest nations\xa0on earth?\nHas your Government been at\xa0war for 214 years out of the last 235?\nDoes your Government\xa0hire,\xa0or threaten journalists in order to have them\xa0write false news stories, and even\xa0film fake execution videos\xa0that advance their propaganda?\n\n\nAre your\xa0daily news shows filled with a combination of trivial entertainment\xa0and stories about why you should\xa0remain fearful of a variety of dangers\xa0all around you?\nAre more people in your nation currently on more\xa0anti-depressant medications\xa0than\xa0any other nation on earth?\nAre more than\xa050 percent of the children in your nation living below the poverty line?\n\n\nDo\xa0large corporations have more power over the laws, the policies, the courts, and the politicians than you \u2013 a tax paying, registered voter?\nIs the most popular \u201cnews\u201d source for most people in your country\xa0actually a comedy show that routinely exposes the truth about your Fascist government?\n\n\nSo, how did your nation score? Chances are, you may start to realize that your nation is already oppressing you, lying to you, exploiting you, manipulating you, and\xa0not representing your interests at all.\nWhat can you do about it? Politically, not much. Fascist regimes are usually only taken down by outside powers or invading forces. So, other than hoping for a violent revolution in the streets, or praying for another nation to topple your government, here\u2019s what I recommend:\nThe Gospel.\nI know, I know. It sounds so weak in comparison to the bombs and the tanks and the missiles, not to mention the NSA, the FBI, the CIA and the secret prisons. But here\u2019s the deal: The love of Jesus changes people. It transforms them from the inside out. It makes them new again.\n\n\nThis Gospel is a highly-effective, long-term, world-changing virus designed by the Greatest Mind in the Universe. It has the power to make every weapon useless and render every world power powerless.\nAs a follower of Jesus, I am a subversive agent of a Kingdom with unlimited powers.\nMy mission is to overthrow this empire from within and to unravel its systems and re-boot the culture.\nThis is accomplished by introducing the Gospel virus into the existing mainframe of reality. This \u201cMetanoia Class\u201d program is designed to re-write the code of our thinking. It has the power to re-wire hearts, reprogram minds, and transform human behaviors.\nThe purpose of this Gospel is to increase the number of radicalized agents into our culture and exponentially advance the range and effect of the Metanoia program.\nOur leader has given us access to an unlimited source of life and power. Our lines of communication with him cannot be tapped, traced or interrupted. We can receive messages from our source at any time, at any place, regardless of access to electricity, infrastructure or technology.\nOne by one, we are now in the process of changing the world from within. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, we are transforming people from darkness into glorious light. Those who formerly walked in the shadows are now awakening to the inescapable truth. Every second of every day, people around the globe turn from walking in the way of this world and begin to follow the way of life contained in the Metanoia program.\n\n\nThose who are infected by this unique virus have begun to think different, and to act different, than other humans around them. They begin to take on the same heart and mind and perspective of our leader, Y\u2019Shua of Nazareth; loving those who hate them; forgiving those who seek to harm them; seeing everyone as a potential brother or sister and a future operative in the program.\nWe are not alone. Our numbers are legion. Our methods are varied, but nonetheless subtle and unstoppable by any government, law or threat known to man.\nThe weaker we grow, the more powerful we become. The more you oppose us, the greater our effectiveness.\nOur victory is assured.\nWe have outlasted every empire for the last 2,000 years. We have endured persecution, torture, and even death. We may die, but our mission carries forward. No force on earth, or even the entire universe, can stop us, or defeat us, or destroy us.\nOur lives are already lost. We have surrendered all to this single purpose and calling. Our death was accounted for on the day we embarked on this mission.\nWe have no fear. All fear has been erased by an irresistible love that permeates our existence. We are guided by this love and fully compelled that it alone is the hope for all life on this planet.\n\n\nWe have no country. We owe no allegiance to any nation, state or ideology other than that of our King.\nWe have no armory. The weapons we employ are love, compassion, service, mercy, and grace. Combined with prayer, hope, trust, and faith, these are all we need to accomplish our goals.\nMake no mistake, this world is fading away. A new world is coming. Behold, the kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our God.\nNothing you can do will change this. The insurgency will prevail.\nJoin us and live.\nNOTE: This post was adapted from a previous post.\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God from the Bible\u201d,\xa0is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\n\n\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

128,Introducing Christians To Jesus,"July 6, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nI realized the other day that I spend a lot of my time trying to introduce Christians to Jesus. The hard thing is, most of them don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re not following Jesus. They think that because they are \u201cChristians\u201d or because they prayed the sinner\u2019s prayer, that means they\u2019re Christ-followers. Unfortunately, no.\nHere\u2019s how I know this: I used to be just like them.\n\n\n\nI was actually a licensed and ordained minister of the Gospel who had served as a youth pastor, children\u2019s pastor and compassion ministry pastor at several different churches over a ten year period who did not realize that following Jesus and being a Christian were not the same thing.\nActually, what I didn\u2019t realize was that the Gospel wasn\u2019t about saying a prayer so you could go to heaven when you die. Once I realized that everything changed.\nThe Gospel, according to Jesus, and as explained in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John is simply this: \u201cRepent! [Literally, \u201cThink different!\u201d] \u201cThe Kingdom of God is at hand!\u201d\nJesus\u2019s entire ministry was spent proclaiming the Kingdom of God was here \u2013 right now \u2013 and that anyone and everyone could experience the rule and reign of Christ in their life today.\nIn other words, the Gospel that Jesus preached was a Gospel for your life, not a Gospel that waited to kick in after you were dead.\nWhat confuses so many Christians today about the Gospel is that they tend to follow Paul rather than Jesus. Because of this, they take Paul\u2019s statement out of context when he says:\n\n\n\u201cNow I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I proclaimed to you, which you have also received, in which you also stand,\xa02\xa0by which you are also being saved, if you hold fast to the message I proclaimed to you, unless you believed to no purpose.\xa03\xa0For I passed on to you\xa0as of first importance\xa0what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,\xa04\xa0and that he was buried, and that he was raised up on the third day according to the scriptures,\xa05\xa0and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve,\xa06\xa0then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, the majority of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.\u201d [1 Cor. 15:1-6]\nSo, is this the Gospel? Well, it\u2019s part of the Gospel. But the Gospel is defined by Jesus, not by Paul. The 4 books of the New Testament that are called \u201cGospels\u201d are where we find the Gospel. [Can\u2019t believe I just needed to type that].\n\n\n\n\nBut, it\u2019s not as if Paul had one Gospel and Jesus had another. Far from it. Paul preached the same Gospel of the Kingdom and he tells us so, many, many times:\n\u201cI have gone [among you] preaching the kingdom of God\u201d \u2013 Acts 20:25\n\u201cWe must go through many tribulations to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d \u2013 Acts 14:22\n\u201cFor the kingdom of God is\u2026righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\u201d \u2013 Romans 14:17\n\u201cFor the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.\u201d \u2013 1 Cor. 4:20\n\u201cPaul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.\u201d \u2013 Acts 19:8\n\u201cHe [Paul] witnessed to them from morning till evening, explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus.\u201d \u2013 Acts 28:23\n\u201cHe [Paul] proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ\u2014with all boldness and without hindrance!\u201d \u2013 Acts 28:31\n\u201cNow I [Paul] know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.\u201d \u2013 Acts 29:25\n\n\nThere is only one Gospel and it is the Gospel that Jesus came and died to proclaim: We are all invited to experience a connection with the Divine \u2013 here and now \u2013 through the abiding and indwelling Spirit of Christ.\nThis is what the New Covenant is all about! This is what God had in mind all along:\n\u201cI will be your God and you will be my people\u2026and no one will inquire of his neighbor, or his brother,\xa0saying,\xa0\u2018Know Yahweh,\u2019 for all of them will know me, from their\xa0smallest\xa0and up to their\xa0greatest,\u201d [Jer. 31:31]\nThis New Covenant is what Jesus established in his own blood and body. We celebrate this everytime we share Communion together and with Him.\nGod has come near. His name is Emmanuel. We can know Him directly \u2013 deeply and intimately \u2013 without any mediator between us and Him except for Christ who came to reveal the Father to us.\nDear Christian, let me introduce you to Jesus.\n**\nKeith Giles new book\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d, is\xa0available now on Amazon and features a Foreword by author Brian Zahnd.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.\nKeith also co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

129,The Elephant In The Church,"July 3, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nFor many Christians, the idea of separating their faith and their politics is absurd. They see nothing wrong with having an American flag in the sanctuary. They have no problem pledging allegiance to the flag before the service starts. They sincerely believe that being patriotic and Christian is perfectly fine \u2013 even normal.\n\n\nBut for the first 300 years of Church history, no Christian would have ever pledged allegiance to their birth nation. To do so would have been treason. In fact, Christians were martyred BECAUSE they refused to declare that Caesar was Lord and went to their deaths shouting, \u201cI have no King but Jesus.\u201d \nAll of that began to change when Constantine entangled the Church and the State. \nBut, I\u2019d like to ask a question: In over 6,000 years of human history, how many of mankind\u2019s basic problems have been solved by politicians? \nNone of them.\xa0\n\nHow many of man\u2019s sins have been dealt with by all the greatest politicians who have ever lived? \nNone.\n\nAs stewards who must one day give an account of our money and time, why would we invest anything in a system with such a disappointing track record for success?\n\nPolitics is about writing and passing and enforcing laws. Even God\u2019s Law wasn\u2019t capable of transforming the hearts of men and women. Why do we still believe that we can do better?\n\n\n\nDo we really need more laws? Do we need better people writing the laws? Is our problem the lack of law enforcement?\n\nWhat does the Bible have to say about all of that? Do experts in the Law set us free? Is the Law capable of changing us into the image of God?\xa0\n\n\u201cFor if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.\u201d (Gal. 2:21)\xa0\n\nLet me ask you this: What if there was something that could reform the convict? What if there was a formula for changing people into better citizens? What if there was hope for every broken marriage? What if every addict could find hope for life beyond their daily habit? What if there was a way to create an entire society of people who loved one another, cared for one another, and went out of their way to bless everyone around them?\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that there is something like that. But, what if? Just imagine it! Wouldn\u2019t something that revolutionary \u2013 something with the power to change every human heart from within and make them a brand new creature \u2013 wouldn\u2019t that be better than any political solution you had ever heard of in your life?\n\nAnd if \u2013 just if \u2013 that sort of society-changing paradigm actually existed, wouldn\u2019t it be foolish to waste your time on a political solution? Especially if, so far, not one single politician or ideology had ever once come close to something nearly so effective and powerful?\n\nSeveral years ago I was in a Christian band. I wanted more than anything in the world to get signed to record deal. Why? So I could share the Gospel with more people, I told myself. But eventually I had to admit the truth: I wanted to get signed to a record deal because I wanted to be famous. I had to admit that if I really wanted more people to hear the Gospel, our band could play bars and clubs and street corners.\xa0\n\nMixing Politics and Christianity is no different. We may tell ourselves that we\u2019re doing it because we want our nation to be more Christian. But if that\u2019s what we really wanted, we\u2019d spend more time preaching the Gospel and living out the commands of Jesus in our daily life.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nBesides, do you know what you get when you mix religion and politics? You get politics.\nThe truth is: Legislation will never change anyone\u2019s heart. The Gospel is not spread through Political Initiatives or Laws.\xa0\n\nLet\u2019s just admit that when we seek political solutions to our problems it\u2019s because we\u2019ve given up on changing the world by sharing the Gospel and now we just want to pass laws to force people who are not Christians to act like we do so we\u2019ll feel more comfortable in this society.\n\nNo political agenda, party, system, or politician will ever bring our nation any closer to the image of God. Only Jesus can do that.\xa0\n\nOur core problems, as a human race, are spiritual in nature. The only solution is spiritual.\xa0\nJesus is our answer. He is the only answer.\xa0\n\nNo other additives or preservatives are required.\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

130,Love As Promised (But Not As Expected),"June 28, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Scott Laumann\nThe Messiah came as promised, but not as expected.\nThey wanted a warrior. They got a baby.\nThey wanted a King. They got a shepherd.\nThey wanted regime change in Israel. They got regime change in their hearts.\nJesus subverted their ideas of Messiah. He came as the unexpected answer to their prayers for freedom, and liberty, and salvation.\n\n\nThey expected a violent revolutionary. They got a peaceful revolutionary who disarmed their hearts and transformed their lives.\nWhen this unexpected Messiah came, he made new promises.\nJesus made a promise that his disciples would love extravagantly. They would be people who loved their enemies. They would be people who would forgive their debtors. They would be people who would rather die than harm others.\nOur job now is to become ambassadors of that promise.\nJesus also gave to us the ministry of reconciliation. He gave us a mission to declare that \u201dGod was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself and NOT counting men\u2019s sins against them.\u201d [2 Cor. 5:19]\nOur mission is to announce this \u201cGood News\u201d to everyone: That they are loved beyond measure.\n\u201cBut, they don\u2019t deserve it! No one deserves it!\u201d, we are quick to say.\nI wonder, would you ever tell your child that you love them, but then quickly emphasize how little they deserved your love?\nHopefully not.\nWhy? Because they don\u2019t NEED to deserve your love. You love them because of who they are, and who you are.\nGood parents don\u2019t tell their children that they are undeserving of love.\n\n\nAnd neither does God, by the way.\nWhen the scriptures expound on the immeasurable love of God for each of us, it NEVER stops to mention how little we deserve that love. Never.\nWe are the ones who add that part in ourselves. We are so uncomfortable with God\u2019s exceptional adoration of us that we feel an instinctive need to focus on our own unworthiness. But God never does that.\nGo and look for yourself. Read Ephesians 3:18-19 where we are encouraged \u201cto grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ and to know this love that surpasses knowledge\u2014that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.\u201d\nGuess what is not mentioned in this chapter [or even in the entire book of Ephesians] \u2013 the idea that we are worms who do not deserve God\u2019s, immeasurable love.\nGo and read Romans 8:35-39 and notice this question:\n\u201cWho shall separate us from the love of Christ?\xa0Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?\u2026No, in all these things we are more than conquerors\xa0through him who loved us.\xa0For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,\xa0neither the present nor the future,\xa0nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God\xa0that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAnd nowhere in this entire book of Romans is it ever mentioned that we do not deserve this inescapable love of Christ. Nowhere.\nHe goes on to say:\n\u201cAnd I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God\u2019s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow\u2014not even the powers of hell can separate us from God\u2019s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below\u2014indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d\nSee? We are loved whether we like it or not. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s glorious. And it is non-stop, full-blast, 24/7 ours at all times, no matter what.\nWe are loved.\nSo, why do we go on and on about our unworthiness? I have to wonder.\nHow do we determine what something is worth? Isn\u2019t that based on what someone is willing to pay? If you underpay for something, you\u2019re getting a bargain. But if you overpay, you just got ripped off.\nDid God get ripped off when He paid for us? Hardly.\nGod decided how much we were worth. God set the price, and then God paid that price willingly.\n\n\nWe were bought with a price, according to 1 Cor. 6:20 and 7:23. That price was the life of Jesus.\nThis is what we are worth. This is our value, according to God.\nSo, we are worthy of His love. We are deserving of God\u2019s affections. Every single one of us.\nOur job is to let people know how loved they already are.\nThey deserve to know they are loved beyond measure by a God who is love incarnate.\nThey are loved without doing anything to deserve it.\nThey are loved whether they like it or not.\nEven if they don\u2019t believe in the God who loves them, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are loved.\nThis love is unexpected, but it is exactly as promised.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

131,The 5 Degrees of Love,"June 27, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nOver the weekend I was in Grafton, Ohio [near Cleveland], speaking at a Forum on \u201cCrucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d While there, the host of the event, Pastor Jim Thornton, mentioned something about the \u201c4 Degrees of Love\u201d originally described by Bernard of Clairvaux, a French Catholic monk born in 1090.\n\n\nAccording to Bernard, there are 4 Degrees of Love which are described as follows:\n\nThe First Degree: To love oneself for the sake of oneself \u2013 In other words, to be totally self-absorbed and selfish.\n\xa0The Second Degree: To love God for the sake of oneself\xa0\u2013 This is when you understand that loving God is in your own best interest. So, you love God because if you do God will bless you and your life will be much smoother.\nThe Third Degree: To love God for God\u2019s sake \u2013 In this stage, you begin to genuinely love God for who God is, and no other reason. Your love for God is sincere and honestly an outpouring of your own deepest emotions.\nThe Fourth Degree: To love oneself for God\u2019s sake \u2013 This is where it gets interesting. In this stage, you have begun to love God \u2013 and to know God \u2013 so intimately, that you realize that what God loves most of all is YOU. Therefore, because your love for God is for God\u2019s own sake, you realize that nothing would make God happier than for you to love yourself the way God loves you.\n\n\xa0\nCan you imagine loving God this way? What would it be like? Could we truly love ourselves because God loves us? Are we capable of loving God so much that we realize that loving ourselves the\xa0way God loves us is actually the ultimate way for us to demonstrate our love for God?\n\n\nI shared this with my wife, Wendy, the day after flying home from the event. As I shared the final stage of Bernard\u2019s 4 Degrees of Love, she had a strange reaction. Instead of saying, \u201cWow\u201d, as I expected her to, she looked at me sideways and said, \u201cWhat about loving others?\u201d\nThere it was. Subconsciously I think I knew that something felt incomplete about Bernard\u2019s thesis, but I wasn\u2019t able to put my finger on it. She had intuitively noticed the missing element: Love for others.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great point,\u201d I said. After a few minutes of thinking, I added, \u201cMaybe if we recognize that God is in others the same way God is in us, then our reaction will be to love God in other people, too?\u201d\nThat seemed to make more sense to her, and to me. So, maybe there are actually 5 Degrees of Love?\nIf our love for God reaches the place that we love God for who God is, and we learn to love ourselves because God loves us more than we can imagine, then we can learn to love others because we recognize that God is alive in everyone around us. We are all God\u2019s children. We are all made in God\u2019s image. God is living and breathing in every living human being on this planet, right now.\n\n\nThis is why Jesus can say that if we show love and compassion to anyone, we are showing it to Him, too.\nAs Paul said to the pagan idol worshippers in Athens about the God who made the world, \u201cIn Him we live and move and have our being, as some of your own poets have said, \u2018We are His offspring.'\u201d [Acts 17:16-34]\nWe love God best when we love ourselves, and others, the way God loves us.\n\u201cA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\u201d \u2013 Jesus [Jn. 13:34]\nThe beautiful thing about love is: The more you give away, the more you have.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

132,Saved By Zero,"June 25, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nI had an interesting dream the other night that was a combination of philosophy, theology and mathematics. I\u2019ll do my best to communicate this in blog form but it might be something that works better as a live presentation or dialog. Let me know if this makes sense or not.\nThe philosopher Xeno had a theory which worked on paper (in theory) but was not possible to recreate in the real world. In essence, Xeno proved mathematically that it was impossible for any object to travel from point A to point B. In his example, it was an arrow.\n\n\nXeno\u2019s theory worked like this:\nBefore an arrow can travel the distance to the target, it must first travel half that distance. But before it can travel the half distance it has to first travel half of that distance also. In short, as each distance is cut in half, Xeno demonstrates that there is no measurement of distance that cannot be divided in half. Therefore, you\u2019d have an infinite series of points that need to be crossed in order for the arrow to travel from the bow to the target.\xa0\xa0(Google \u201cXeno\u2019s Arrow\u201d if you need help understanding this concept).\nThis theory is true mathematically, but to prove it false all you have to do is to fire the arrow and hit the target. Theorem refuted.\nBut not so fast. What Xeno actually proved is that there are some concepts which are true (actual infinites) but that do not exist in the physical reality we all live in. Xeno actually proved several things:\nFirst, that actual infinites do exist (otherwise math would not work).\nSecond, that there are things that exist (because we can prove them mathematically or otherwise) but that do not exist in this world. Therefore there is a world outside of this one where these concepts or truths do exist.\n\n\nThirdly, that since actual infinites do not exist in the physical reality, our universe is not infinite. (This means that our universe had an actual beginning and is not eternal).\nThe simplest way to express Xeno\u2019s arrow is to draw a number line. This is where you have a line with zero in the center which counts upward from positive one leading towards infinity on the right, and counting backward from negative one towards infinity on the left. The end of each line has an arrow which indicates that the numbers (both positive and negative) extend outward into infinity.\nThis number line exists on the page, and it exists theoretically in mathematics, but it does not exist in our actual world. In other words, you could not ever hand me an actual number line in the real world. No one can actually produce one, even though it can be proven to exist theoretically.\nWith me so far? Ok, here\u2019s where I\u2019m going to get theological.\n\n\nIf we think of Infinity as God, then we can look at this from two different perspectives \u2013 Either this proves that God exists or it proves that God does not exist.\nFor example, if you take the perspective that God does not exist then you might be tempted to say that since an actual Infinite cannot exist in this reality (or Universe) then God does not exist. In other words, I can demonstrate on paper that an actual Infinite exists mathematically, but I could also draw a Leprechaun on a piece of paper and that wouldn\u2019t prove that they are real.\nHowever, you could also take the perspective that God does not exist in this physical reality (or is not limited to or limited by this reality) but that His existence\xa0can\xa0be proven mathematically (since without this concept of an actual Infinite our mathematical calculations would not be true).\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s mentally turn our number line from left to right into an up and down line, with the negative line going up into heaven and the positive line pointing down towards the Earth. (There\u2019s a reason why I don\u2019t turn it the other way but I\u2019ll explain that in a moment).\n\n\nIf we think of the Spiritual realm as being the negative infinite side of our number line and the positive infinite side as physical reality, then I have a theological thought to share.\nWhen the Apostle\u2019s Paul and\xa0\xa0John were talking about the incarnation of Jesus, they were doing math. (Stay with me here).\nJohn says in his Gospel (see chapter one of John) that \u201cIn the beginning was the Word (that\u2019s Jesus) and the Word was with God [that is an actual infinite], and the Word was God [or, Jesus was equal to infinity]\u2026and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.\u201d [And the question is, \u201cHow?\u201d]\nPaul says this in Philippians:\n\u201cYour attitude should be the same as that of Christ, Jesus, who, being in very nature God,\xa0[that is, being equal to Infinity]\xa0did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing\xa0[or, Jesus became Zero]\xa0by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness[that is, became a positive one on the number line.]\u201d\n\n\nJesus was equal to Infinity (or God), and we already know that our reality cannot contain an actual Infinite object, or being. Therefore, the only way for God (the actual Infinite) to approach the positive reality was to empty Himself of Infinity and become Zero.\nJesus emptied Himself of Infinity to become zero and by His own admission Jesus could do nothing on His own, but only what He saw the Father doing. [See John 5:19; 5:30; 12:49-50; 14:24; 14:31]\nHere\u2019s where it gets tricky. Zero does exist in our reality. It is possible to create an object which contains an absolute vacuum and is, therefore, literally, full of nothing, or zero.\nUnless of course, you want to argue that even that vacuum isn\u2019t full of nothing because space is something. In fact, you\u2019d be right about that since, at the subatomic level, every atom is 99 percent empty space. So, even solid objects are literally full of (mostly) nothing.\nI\u2019m not sure if that makes any sense to anyone other than myself, but it was the idea that woke me up this morning about 3 a.m. and I had to write it down.\n\n\nLove to hear your thoughts about this if you have any.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

133,Fearless,"June 22, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nSo, as I\u2019m drilling down to uncover why so many of those who profess to know Christ are comfortable with killing, and torture, and war, I\u2019ve discovered something:\xa0It turns out that what we really seem to lack is an abiding connection to the love of Christ in our daily, walking around lives.\nAt least, I cannot personally fathom how anyone who was abiding in Christ \u2013 who is Agape love incarnate \u2013 could look at another person made in the image of God and condone their torture, or approve of their death, or justify their suffering \u2013 even if it was in the best interest of our nation.\n\n\nNot only are we disconnected from the love of Christ ourselves \u2013 and lacking in love for one another \u2013 we are also more often ruled by our fears than by our confidence in our Lord Jesus.\nThe truth is, our world is inundated with a continual, abiding fear. We are immersed in fear. We are surrounded by it. It is nearly inescapable in our culture today.\nDon\u2019t believe me? Just watch the evening news and count how often the word \u201cfear\u201d is used. Listen for how many times the news anchors refer to people who are afraid, or who are horrified, or terrified, etc. and you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m talking about.\nThen pay attention to the TV shows you watch. Notice how often fear is used to motivate everyone\u2019s actions. Or how those real-life mystery shows train you to suspect your spouse or to mistrust your neighbors.\nIt\u2019s on the Internet too. Just the other day I posted this on social media:\n\u201cFear says: Buy bigger guns, locks and dogs to protect yourself.\nLove says: Welcome friend. What\u2019s mine is yours.\u201d\n\n\nThe reaction I received to that was this:\n\u201cEasy enough to say until you\u2019re watching some thug rape your wife or daughter.\u201d\nWow. Instant, automatic fear response. (And, yes, this was from a Christian).\nOur choice is simple: We either decide to remain in a place of fear \u2013 and then we make decisions that flow from that fear \u2013 OR we decide to live in the love of Christ and then we make decisions that flow from Him and His love.\nLet\u2019s not kid ourselves here, we cannot do both.\nEither we put our hope in Christ and we walk in His love, or we walk in fear and we live our lives as people who must manage those fears.\nLet\u2019s consider this for a moment: Could someone who honestly put their hope in Christ ever live in continual fear? Of course not! And someone who is led by their fears can\u2019t \u2013 at the same time \u2013 be completely trusting the Lord and placing their hope in Him. The two are mutually exclusive.\nAs I\u2019ve said once before, Jesus came and introduced us to something called \u201cThe Good News (or Gospel) of the Kingdom\u201d and it is about complete submission and daily reliance upon Christ.\n\n\nWe either follow the Way of the World (which involves fear, and violence, and torture, and power, etc.), or we follow the Way of Christ (which involves trust, and love, and humility and service to others, etc.).\nWe cannot follow the Way of the World and the Way of Christ at the same time. It\u2019s like saying that you\u2019re going to get in your car and drive East and West at the same time. It can\u2019t be done.\n\n\nEither go one way or the other, but you can\u2019t do both because one path will take you in the opposite direction from the other one.\nWhy am I writing about fear? Because fear is the flip side of the coin from love. We\u2019re told that\xa0\u201cPerfect love casts out all fear.\u201d\xa0(1 Jn. 4:18) And I believe that if we cling to our fears we\u2019ll also experience less love and suffer from the effects of that deficiency.\nAnyone who doubts this can simply look around you. Our world is not following the Way of Christ. It is saturated with fear. It is ruled by fear. It is all about power and control and exploitation and selfishness.\n\n\nJesus came and died to demonstrate a better way. That\u2019s what we call the Good News.\nIt means we can abandon those ways of being and start living a different way \u2013 a Heavenly way. It means we can actually be transformed from within by His incredible love and His amazing Holy Spirit into people who are not ruled by fear any longer.\nBecause we put our continual hope in Jesus we can love without fearing pain. We can trust without fearing violence. We can give without fearing poverty. We can share without fearing guilt.\nAs followers of Jesus, we have to say no to fear and yes to love. We have to repent and turn away from the way of the world. We have to put our hearts into His capable hands and begin to trust Him with everything. We have to start learning how to walk in love and to leave fear behind us for good.\nAbiding in Christ means abandoning fear. The only thing that casts out all fear is His perfect love. When we are filled with his love there is no more room for fear. When His love fills us, we can\u2019t help but love everyone around us \u2013 even our enemies.\n\n\n\u201cI pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord\u2019s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge\u2014that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.\u201d (Eph. 3:16-19)\n**\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/06/fearless/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
134,The Mark Of The Beast: Revealed!,"June 21, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nWhen it comes to the book of Revelation there are ultimately two camps: Futurists (who believe the book tells us something about future events that have not happened yet) and Preterists (who believe the book told First Century Christians about events that would \u201csoon come to pass\u201d in their lifetime).\n\n\nI am not a Futurist. As such, I read the book of Revelation as a prophecy about events that have already taken place (from our perspective) and were fulfilled soon after John wrote them during the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.\nBecause of my perspective, I do not believe that the \u201cMark of the Beast\u201d has anything to do with current or future events. So, when friends of mine post links to Facebook about a new computer chip that allows people to store their medical records, or purchase products by placing the chip under a scanner, I do not equate this with the end of the world, the rise of the Anti-Christ, or the Mark of the Beast.\nSince people seem to be very interested in this topic, I wanted to at least provide a different perspective to help balance things out a bit.\nThe Mark of the Beast\nWhen John wrote the epistle of Revelation to the seven churches, he made it very clear \u2013 on numerous occasions \u2013 that the prophecies contained in his letter were to take place \u201csoon\u201d.\nFor example: In verse 1, John says:\xa0\u201cThe Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must shortly take place\u2026.\u201d\n\n\nIn verse 3 he says:\xa0\u201c\u2026. and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.\u201d\nJohn uses specific words in the Greek throughout his epistle which mean: \u201cShortly\u201d, \u201cWithout delay\u201d, \u201cSoon\u201d, \u201cIn a short time\u201d, \u201cNear\u201d, \u201cAbout to\u201d, etc.\nThere can be little doubt, therefore, that the First Century Christians who received and read John\u2019s letter understood at least one thing: They were reading about events that were about to happen very, very soon.\nKeeping this in mind, let\u2019s see if we can identify \u201cThe Beast\u201d from Revelation. First, since John is writing to First Century Christians about events that were about to happen quickly, then we can be sure that \u201cThe Beast\u201d was a contemporary of John.\nSecondly, John describes this as either a person (Rev. 13:18), or as several people (Rev. 17:10), or as a government or kingdom (Rev. 17:9).\nFirst Century Christians would have been very familiar with Old Testament references in Daniel to the Four Beasts (Dan. 7:17) which corresponded to Four Kingdoms or Empires. Therefore those readers would have known that John\u2019s references to \u201cThe Beast\u201d in his letters pointed to the Empire of their own day \u2013 The Roman Empire.\n\n\nBut what about the person who is referred to as \u201cThe Beast\u201d?\nSince the Apostle John was writing this letter from captivity on the Island of Patmos, he reverted to code which his readers (Jewish Christians) would understand easily but his captors (The Romans) would not. Note also that, as a prisoner of Rome, he wouldn\u2019t want to come right out and write anything negative about the Emperor or the Government that held him captive \u2013 for obvious reasons. This is why, when he wants to let Christians know that \u201cThe Beast\u201d is the Emperor Nero, he would say:\n\u201cHere is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.\u201d (Rev. 13:18)\nThe Hebrew spelling of \u201cNero Caesar\u201d was NRWN QSR. Since Hebrew letters doubled as numbers it was a simple thing to take that name and add them together which adds up exactly to 666. [Example: N = 50 R = 200 W = 6 N =50 Q = 100 S = 60 R = 200]\nOne fascinating variant of this same passage notes that \u201cSome manuscripts read: 616\u201d rather than 666. Why? Because when Revelation was later copied into Latin the name Nero Caesar didn\u2019t add up to 666, it added up to 616. So, to make it easier for those later Latin-speaking (non Hebrew reading) Christians to arrive at the same conclusion the number was changed to 616 in certain translations.\n\n\nWant more proof? Ok. In Revelation 17:9-10 John tells us:\n\u201cHere is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits, and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve probably heard that the \u201cseven mountains\u201d correspond to the seven hills of Rome. However, did you know that the seven kings also point to Nero as \u201cThe Beast\u201d? They do. Because John tells us that: \u201cFive have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come and when he comes, he must remain a little while.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to Josephus, the Roman historian, Julius Caesar was the first king, followed by August, Tiberius, Caligula and Claudius. The sixth king? That was Nero. So, he is the \u201cone (who) is\u201d.\nThe seventh king \u2013 the one who followed Nero \u2013 was Galba, and as John prophesied, he reigned for a short time (about seven months).\nNero, as the sixth king of Rome, was the first to persecute Christians in the First Century. He started persecuting them in November of 64 AD and ended on June 8, 68 AD when he killed himself. That was 42 months of persecution. Notice what John says about \u201cThe Beast\u201d:\n\n\n\u201cAnd there was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies; and authority to act for forty-two months was given him.\u201d (Rev. 13:5)\nCoincidence? I think not. Clearly John is going out of his way to let his readers know that \u201cThe Beast\u201d had a name that, in the Hebrew, added up to a number (666) and that he was the sixth, and current king of Rome, and that his persecution would last exactly 42 months. What could be more clear than this?\nExtra-Biblical Proof\nNero was also called \u201cThe Beast\u201d by contemporary pagan writer Apollinius of Tyana, who said of Nero:\n\u201cIn my travels\u2026I have seen many wild beasts of Arabia and India; but this beast, that is commonly called a Tyrant, I know not how many heads it has, nor if it be crooked of claw, and armed with horrible fangs\u2026. And of wild beasts you cannot say that they were ever known to eat their own mother, but Nero gorged himself on this diet.\u201d\nNote that Nero murdered his own parents, and his brother, and his pregnant wife, in addition to several other family members.\n\n\nWe also have evidence from the Romans that Nero enjoyed dressing up as a wild beast and raping male and female prisoners.\nStill not convinced? Consider that all of the earliest Church Fathers from Irenaeus in the First Century, all the way through to St. Beatus in the 8th\xa0century agreed that \u201cThe Beast\u201d was Nero.\nBuying and Selling?\nRoman citizens were required to publicly claim allegiance to Caesar by burning incense in his honor and proclaiming that \u201cCaesar is Lord\u201d. Those who did this received a document that allowed them to buy and sell in the marketplace. Without it, no one could purchase anything. Therefore, the \u201cMark of the Beast\u201d \u2013 or the document that showed your allegiance to Nero as Lord \u2013 was required to buy and sell if you lived during the time when John wrote his epistle to the seven churches.\nNone of those Christians who read Revelation were confused about what John meant by this. It was already happening to them.\n\n\nIn Conclusion:\xa0The Mark of the Beast is not a microchip. It is not a barcode. It is not your credit card. The Beast was Emperor Nero. The Mark of the Beast was \u201cthe number of his name\u201d which added up to 666. We\u2019re told that The Beast would reign in terror for 42 months and Nero\u2019s persecution of the Church lasted exactly 42 months.\nQuestions?

135,Why We Love Law More Than The Gospel,"June 20, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nToday was the perfect storm of Christians praising the Law of Moses, I guess.\nFirst, a friend on Facebook posted a statement about how \u201cRomans 13 is clear: violators of the Law will suffer the consequences\u201d in reference to how immigrant children are being torn from their parents. [More on that in a moment].\n\n\nThen, another friend made a comment about how America needs to get back to \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019 and \u2018a life for a life\u2019 if we want to solve our gun violence problems. [A statement that makes zero sense, but underscores the same way of thinking as the post above].\nAmerican Christians really love the Law. We want to post the 10 Commandments in every courthouse. We want to hold everyone to that Old Testament Levitical standard [not ALL of it, or course. We still love shrimp, lobster and cheeseburgers, but we would really LOVE to go back to stoning rebellious teens who weary baggy pants or vape, and put homosexuals to death, for example].\nThis is very troubling to me.\nWhy? Because, first of all, it says that Christians in America have not yet fully understood or accepted the Gospel of Christ. If they had, they wouldn\u2019t keep running back to the Law or the 10 Commandments for direction\u2026.they\u2019d be running to Jesus.\nBut, they realize that if they were to run to Jesus they\u2019d have to listen to Him say, \u201cNeither do I condemn you\u201d and \u201cYour sins are forgiven\u201d and \u201cI desire mercy, not sacrifice\u201d, among other things.\n\n\nJesus is just too merciful and kind and forgiving and loving. [Eww]\nWe much prefer a God who is angry, wrathful, full of righteous indignation, judgment, and good, old-fashioned condemnation.\nThe second reason this troubles me is that it means those who are NOT Christians start to believe that this IS what Jesus is all about. So, not only do Christians not understand who Jesus was, or what Jesus was all about, those who need Jesus most are being told that Jesus is no different than Zeus, or Molech who demands worship, has no patience for unbelievers and is swift to punish, smite and reject any and all who dare oppose His majestic power.\nThis is not who Jesus is. It is not who God is either.\nJesus told us to refer to God as our \u201cDaddy\u201d \u2013 our \u201cPappa\u201d \u2013 or \u201cAbba\u201d. God, according to Christ, is a patient, kind, loving Father who longs to hold is in His arms, place us in His lap, laugh with us, play with us, and delight in us. Because He loves us. Because we are His children. Because He is a good Father who loves to give good gifts to His kids.\nSo, how do we respond when a Christian wants to return to the Law? What do we say when Romans 13 is held up as if it\u2019s our standard for justice?\n\n\nHere\u2019s how I responded when my friend argued that \u201cRomans 13 was clear\u2026.\u201d:\nI said, \u201cRomans 12 is even more clear:\n\u201cLove must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 10\xa0Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.11\xa0Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 12\xa0Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 13\xa0Share with the Lord\u2019s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.\n14\xa0Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 15\xa0Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. 16\xa0Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.\n\n\n17\xa0Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. 18\xa0If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 19\xa0Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God\u2019s wrath, for it is written: \u201cIt is mine to avenge; I will repay,\u201d says the Lord. 20\xa0On the contrary:\n\n\n\u201cIf your enemy is hungry, feed him;\nif he is thirsty, give him something to drink.\nIn doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.\u201d\n21\xa0Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\u201d\nSee, 1 Corinthians 12 is what Paul wrote for those who follow Christ. Romans 13 was all about the Empire and the State. We should never get those two things confused. Ever.\nIt\u2019s times like these that I remember how Paul marveled at the Galatians who were so eager to return to the Law, even though the Gospel of Christ had set them free.\nIn Galatians 4:8-11 Paul says:\n\u201cFormerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. But now that you know God\u2014or rather are known by God\u2014how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?\xa0You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.\u201d\xa0\nSometimes I feel the same way: Like I\u2019ve wasted my efforts on people who claim to have heard and understood the Gospel of Christ, and yet still somehow want to remain under the Law of Moses, which Paul said was vanishing, fading, only brought death and was abolished in Christ.\n\n\nHow long before Christians in America have the ears to hear what the Spirit has been saying to the Churches for the last 2,000 years?\nWe are not under the Law anymore. We are under the New Covenant of Christ where love is our only rule and reconciliation and transformation are our only goals.\nHow long? Hopefully, not much longer. Because what the world needs most today are people who are fully convinced that the Gospel of Jesus really is the best \u2013 and only \u2013 hope for our world.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

136,Why Loving Our Enemies Is Easier Than Loving Our Friends,"June 19, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nI just spent the weekend in Portsmouth, Ohio talking with fellow believers about what it looks like to love our enemies as Jesus commanded us. That in itself is a rare conversation to have these days. I was extremely blessed that so many people would show up and sincerely wrestle with this topic in such a real and practical way.\n\n\nMy friend Joshua Lawson was the perfect person to co-host this dialog with. In fact, it was his idea in the first place to talk about how the nonviolent love of Jesus changes us, and the world.\nSo, for more than 4 hours we answered questions from scripture, responded to real-life situations where forgiveness and mercy were required, and talked about how Jesus doesn\u2019t call us to be a doormat but to treat every offense and attack as an opportunity for the Kingdom of God to break into the darkness and transform the lives of people who have never known the audacious, extravagant, life-changing love of Christ.\nWe watched a handful of very powerful video clips about real-life people who had either shown love and mercy to their attackers, or who had their lives forever changed by receiving love and mercy from the very people who should have hated them and rejected them, but who instead forgave them, humanized them, and sincerely loved them for who they were, not for what they had done.\nIt was a glorious weekend and I know that God will nurture many of the seeds we planted there long after I\u2019m gone.\nBut then I got home and some harsh reality set in.\n\n\nA friend of mine, who is a dear brother in Christ, made a comment online that deeply offended me. In fact, it was because I love and respect this person that the offense was so painful. Random strangers who call me names or doubt my character are largely unable to hit their intended target because of the simple fact that I know they don\u2019t know me and they have no idea who I am or what I\u2019m about. I can forgive them instantly and refuse to be offended because I do not have any real-life connection to them.\nBut, when the person who hurts you is someone you know and love, well, that\u2019s another story.\nThe wound\xa0is much deeper, and the pain is more palpable when the one who attacks you is a friend. Maybe because you assume they think the best of you, or that if they had a problem with you they would address it privately and not on the world wide web. Or, maybe it\u2019s because when you let them know they hurt you they\xa0spend more time defending themselves than simply saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d or \u201cI apologize.\u201d Or, it\u2019s all of the above.\nSo, now what do we do? We are still commanded to love our enemies, and even if this person isn\u2019t an enemy, but a friend, the need to respond with love, mercy, and forgiveness is still essential. Maybe even more so because this person is a brother (or a sister) in Christ.\n\n\nI\u2019m reminded that Jesus commanded us to love one another. I think it was in the form of a command because Jesus knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy for us at times and that if He didn\u2019t elevate the stakes for us, we might not take this as seriously as we should.\nIt\u2019s so much easier these days to \u201cunfriend\u201d someone; both in the cyber world and the real one. Especially if you can justify it by saying, \u201cthey hurt me,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t need this in my life.\u201d Those things are both true. They did and you don\u2019t. But honestly, I don\u2019t think Jesus cares about your feelings as much as He cares about your relationships with other people.\nOur horizontal relationships [here on the ground] are intricately related to our vertical relationships [with our Heavenly Father and His Son].\n\n\nNot only do these relationships literally form a cross, they are specifically connected by Jesus as being dependent upon the other.\nWhen Jesus responds to the question about the Greatest Commandment, He says it is \u201cTo love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength\u201d, but then He is quick to add: \u201cAnd the second greatest is like the first: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d\n\n\nNotice that Jesus says that the second commandment [to love our neighbor] is \u201clike the first\u201d [to love God]. In what way are they alike? Well, the Apostle John clarifies that when he says:\n\u201cIf anyone says he loves God but hates his brother, he is a liar\u201d [1 John 4:20]\nJesus also says that if we are in the process of worshipping God but remember that our brother has something against us, we should stop immediately, run to that person and make it right first, and then return to our worship of God. Why? Because the first command is like the second. We cannot maintain our\xa0loving relationship with God if we neglect our loving relationships with other people. They are all intertwined.\nSo, like it or not, [and let\u2019s face it, we don\u2019t], God expects us to live at peace with all men, at least as far as it depends upon us. [See Romans 12:18]\nWe need to forgive. If for no other reason than that we, ourselves, will one day require forgiveness too. If we refuse to sow forgiveness and mercy now, we might not reap it later when we need it most.\nOver the weekend, we talked about how Micah 6:8 says that we should \u201cLove mercy, do justice and walk humbly with our God.\u201d\n\n\nLoving mercy is key. Everone loves mercy when they need it. It feels so good to be forgiven and let off the hook, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s why we should love when mercy is shown to others. Because we know how badly we need it when we screw up. The hard part is to show mercy to people who have hurt us. They don\u2019t deserve it, we think to ourselves. They are the ones who attacked me, not the other way around. But that\u2019s the point. Mercy isn\u2019t deserved. Mercy is granted to those who don\u2019t deserve it. That\u2019s the power of forgiveness.\nIf we are called to love others as Christ loved us, then let\u2019s take a moment to consider just how Christ has loved us. Make a list. Take your time. The realization will quickly overwhelm you once you start to remember all the amazing, beautiful, and precious ways that Jesus has loved you, cared for you, blessed you, and forgiven you.\nNow, go and do likewise.\nI know, it\u2019s not going to be easy. But, I can promise you, it\u2019s going to feel a whole lot better than holding on to your pain and your offense.\nI promise.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\n\n\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

137,Behold: Our Christless Christianity,"June 15, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nJust in case you\u2019re not paying attention, American Christianity is a Christless Christianity.\nWe demand the Ten Commandments to be displayed in our courthouses, but we never give a thought to Jesus\u2019s Sermon on the Mount.\n\n\nWe justify our cruelty to immigrants by quoting random passages from Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans, but skip over dozens of commands from Jesus about showing mercy, caring for the weak and vulnerable, and totally ignore his warning that \u201cwhatever you have done for the least of these, you have done it to me.\u201d\nWe cry out for \u201can eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\u201d to be our standard for justice, but ignore the fact that Jesus specifically corrected this teaching by saying:\n\u201cYou have heard it said, \u2018an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\u2019, but I say to you, do not resist an evil person with violence, but if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.\xa0And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.\xa0If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.\xa0Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.\u201d\n\n\nIn other words: Endure the injustice and take the opportunity to put the extravagant love of Christ\u2019s Kingdom into practice; bring the audacious and everlasting love of God into the daylight and dazzle those whose eyes have never seen or imagined such overwhelming and sincere love. This is how we change the world. This is how we transform our enemies into friends. This is how we end the violence. This is how we push back the darkness \u2013 not with more darkness \u2013 but with true, undeniable light; the light that only comes from God.\nIf the best we can do is take an eye for an eye, we will never escape this world of blindness.\nIf the best we can do is to continue to behave exactly the way we would had\xa0Christ never come and spoken these words of life to us, we will never experience freedom.\n\n\nBut, this is not the best we can do. Not by a longshot.\nWe can stop and reconsider all of this. We can think differently. We can at least try to follow the words of Jesus, if for no other reason than it\u2019s the one thing we have yet to actually try.\nAll other attempts to change the world have failed. All other avenues have long been exhausted.\n\n\nWhat if we try to love one another as Christ has loved us?\nWhat if we consider others better than ourselves?\nWhat if we refuse to regard others from a worldly point of view?\nWhat if we tried to put Christ back in our Christianity?\nHonestly, at this point, what have we got to lose?\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

138,The Unexpected Fruit Of Kindness,"June 12, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nThere was no way I could have anticipated how my little suggestion would explode and impact the lives of hundreds of people on the other side of the country.\nIt was just another meeting at work. One of our vendors wanted to hold an event with our sales team in Buffalo to promote their \u201cBuild To Order\u201d network during the week of September 11th.\n\n\nA few ideas were tossed back and forth, and then I said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have our sales team build backpacks full of school supplies for low-income families?\u201d\nIt was a winner. But I had no idea just how big it would be.\nWeeks went by and I heard nothing. That, in itself, is not unusual. I almost never hear feedback about how these things go. It\u2019s rare to even get a photograph after the fact. But then the news started coming back to me.\nAt first, it was only a comment from the vendor rep who said, \u201cKeith, that was the single best thing I have ever seen or been part of at this company.\u201d\nWow. I was shocked. Then came the internal email which provided photos and details which were overwhelming.\nOver 400 backpacks were stuffed with supplies by hundreds of associates in less than two hours. Two schools in the Buffalo area were awarded 200 backpacks each.\n\n\nThen it got really awesome.\nCisco, the vendor, donated $1,000 for every hundred backpacks we filled. So each school received a check for $2,000 in addition to the backpacks and all of the leftover supplies.\nBut the story wasn\u2019t finished yet. Not by a mile.\nWhen the principals for each school showed up to receive the backpacks they were stunned. One woman, when she saw what was waiting, burst into tears while describing how many of her students are\xa0Refugees. \u201cSome of these kids barely have clothing and can\u2019t afford school supplies,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a dream, how could they be so lucky?\u201d\n\nBy the time she was done telling the stories of these children, there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house.\nThen Cisco decided to make this an annual event. And then the Wall Street Journal did a story on it.\n\n\n\n\nBest of all? Both of those schools will have funds freed up to fund other important programs that, without those checks, would have been canceled completely.\nNot bad for a simple idea at the end of a conference call on a random Tuesday.\n\nWant to know what I love most about all of this? It\u2019s that I have been asking God to show me the fruit of my ministry for a few months now. Mostly because I\u2019ve been feeling as if I need to do more, or be more, or serve more. Then God shows me how much He can do with the most simple and random actions we take. Even when we\u2019re not trying to bear fruit, He can do so much with so little.\nIt really is just about bringing our two loaves and a fish to lay it at His feet. He is the One who does the real work. He is the One who gets the Glory.\nI keep seeing the picture of someone carrying a large sack of seed to the newly plowed field and every little seed that drops off along the way is springing up, growing stronger, bearing fruit \u2013 just as He designed every seed to do.\n\n\nDo you have a story like this? I\u2019d love to hear it!

139,Welcome To Post Christian America,"June 9, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Image:HeavenlyPerspective Kenn Stilger\nA new study from the\xa0Pew Research Center\xa0has found the population of Christians in the United States is on a downward spiral.\nPolling 35,000 Americans aged 18 and older, the poll found that over the last seven years, those calling themselves \u201cChristian\u201d has diminished by 8 percent overall. That\u2019s about 5 million people who have moved out of the Christian faith since 2007.\n\n\nThis new demographic is being called the \u201cNones\u201d (as in \u201cNone of the above\u201d) or the \u201cDones\u201d (as in \u201cDone with\xa0religion\u201d).\nEven more eye-opening is what researchers are identifying as the cause for the ongoing exodus away from the Christian faith:\n\u201cTraditionally, we thought religion was the mover and politics were the consequence,\u201d said\xa0Mike Hout, a New York University sociologist and demographer. However, today more and more are leaving Christian denominations because \u201cthey saw them align with a conservative political agenda and they don\u2019t want to be identified with that.\u201d\nOther researchers, like Religion Dispatches writer Sarah Posner\xa0also points out that, \u201cpolitically speaking, evangelicals, and in particular white evangelicals, have been highly politically organized for decades,\u201d and that trend\u2019s not stopping anytime soon.\nSo, while some\xa0Evangelical Christians\xa0can point to this latest report as proof that they need to \u201credouble their efforts in the culture war\u201d, the truth is that they are actually to blame for creating their own problem.\n\n\nYes, it is very troubling to note that many young people are turning away from the Christian faith. But, are these people truly rejecting legitimate Christianity, or are they actually rejecting a political ideology that is only masquerading as Christianity?\nI would argue the latter is more the case.\nChristians in America are in effect practicing a very self-destructive form of Reverse Evangelism and not only repelling those who are still outside their walls, but alienating many of those who once considered themselves part of the team.\nYet, even as more and more people identify themselves less and less as \u201cChristians\u201d they are \u2013 at the same time \u2013 identifying more and more as \u201cspiritual but not religious\u201d. This indicates a desire to connect with God, and perhaps even with Jesus, but they seek to do so outside the typical constraints of American Christianity. Why? Mostly because this brand of American Christianity largely defines itself politically as an offshoot of the Conservative Republican party, and camps out on pet issues like Gay Marriage and Abortion while ignoring issues that Jesus seemed to care most about like Poverty, Violence, Oppression, and Exploitation of the weakest in our society.\n\n\nAs my friend Ross Rohde notes:\n\u201cMy biggest concern is the damage this does to the Kingdom. We say Jesus is Lord, but we entangle ourselves with the equivalent of the \u201cforeign wives\u201d of the Old Testament. If we can\u2019t untangle ourselves from these strange infatuations, strange loves, then we really aren\u2019t following Jesus at all. We are treating Him like he is here for our salvation, our convenience, and we don\u2019t have any responsibility in the relationship. That\u2019s not treating Jesus as our Lord, it is treating him like a slave we don\u2019t respect. Jesus is Lord, we are to follow Him, not some foreign bride.\u201d\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. But what can we do about this? How can we turn back this troubling tide?\nWe don\u2019t.\nIn fact, I would argue that no one can and we shouldn\u2019t even try.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing here is a very natural reaction to an empty, man-made religion which is more political than spiritual, and that is a very, very good thing. If nothing else it shows that people are smart enough to realize when something doesn\u2019t smell right and they\u2019re willing to walk away from it entirely in pursuit of something more authentic and pure.\n\n\nRather than reverse this process, we should find a way to meet with these spiritual nomads and provide opportunities to address their deepest concerns and respond to their spiritual hunger for more God and less politics.\nHow do we do this? One idea I\u2019ve had recently is to start a Meet Up group online for those who are interested in \u201cJesus Without Religion\u201d, and to start getting together once a week with anyone and everyone who wants to learn more about who Jesus is, and what Jesus taught, and how to follow Jesus without any religious, denominational, or political strings attached.\nMaybe you have another idea? I\u2019d love to hear it. But regardless of how we go about it, the urgency is clear. The game is changing and if we don\u2019t adapt to that change, we will miss a huge opportunity to advance the Kingdom and share the Gospel.\nFACT: The sooner we give up the idea of ever returning to the \u201cGood old days\u201d when Christianity was the norm and everyone went to Church on Sunday, and kids went to Sunday School, and shops were closed on Sunday so everyone could spend time with their Church family, the sooner we can start adapting to the actual world we really do live in right here and right now \u2013 a world where almost no one knows the Bible stories, or can sing \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d, or understands what Flannel graph is.\n\n\nWe live in the midst of a vast mission field where more and more people do not know the Gospel, have no idea who Jesus really is, and do not own or read the Bible.\nWelcome to Post Christian America.\nThis is our chance to get it right.\nThis is our time to shine.\nLet\u2019s not blow it this time around.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

140,The Word \u201cHomosexual\u201d Does Not Appear In The Bible [Pre-1946],"June 5, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nAs I prepare for an online debate on the topic \u201cIs It A Sin To Be Gay?\u201d I realized something profound: No Christians could have possibly debated this topic previous to 1946 because their Bibles didn\u2019t contain the word \u201cHomosexual\u201d before that.\nIt\u2019s true.\n\nGo look at 1 Corinthians 6:9 in your King James Bible and you\u2019ll see this:\n\n\n\u201cKnow ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [malakos], nor abusers of themselves with mankind [arsenoikotai]\u2026\u201d\nBut if you read that same verse in any modern English translation published after 1946 you\u2019ll read something very different, for example:\n\u201cOr do you not know that the unrighteous\xa0will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived:\xa0neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality\u2026\u201d\xa0\nWhat happened?\nWell, according to researcher\xa0Kathy V. Baldock:\n\u201cThe intention of the RSV team and publishers was to create a version of the Bible that was more readable and accessible in its updated language. As the translation team labored throughout the years, they based their work mainly on the King James Version (1611), the ERV (1885), and the American Standard Version (1901).\nHowever\u2026\u201dDuring the 1930s and 1940s, the time when the RSV team was doing their work over a fifteen years span, it was during a time in medical professions and in the culture where people still did not understand what same-sex attractions even meant. There were burgeoning theories, but it was seen as a mystery, then as a pathology, and a mental illness.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpecifically regarding 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, the translation team relied mainly upon a fairly recent translation of\xa0arsenokoitai\xa0and\xa0malakos\xa0as catamite and sodomite, respectively, that had appeared in the Moffat Bible (1925). James Moffatt, a Scottish theologian, was a member of the RSV translation team, and second in seniority to Dr. Weigle.\n\u201cThose two words, although still problematic in the Moffatt translation, were actually somewhat more reflective of the actual meaning of\xa0arsenokoitai\xa0and\xa0malakos\xa0than \u201chomosexual.\u201d\n[Note: The same problem occurs when you look at 1 Timothy 1:10]\nSo, here\u2019s the deal: Today, most Christians in America are reading modern English translations that have since carried over this mistake of translating the words \u201cmalakos\u201d and \u201carsenokoitai\u201d as \u201cHomosexuality\u201d.\nThis is a mistake.\nPrior to 1946, no Christian had a Bible with the word \u201cHomosexuality\u201d printed in it. This means that no Christians were debating whether or not someone could be a homosexual Christian or not. Why? Because their Bibles didn\u2019t condemn homosexuality.\n\n\nAs New Testament scholar David Bentley Hart points out in his commentary on 1 Corinthians 6:9:\n\u201cA man who is malakos is either \u201csoft\u201d \u2013 in any number of senses: self-indulgent, dainty, cowardly\u2026physically weak \u2013 or \u201cgentle\u201d \u2013 in various largely benign senses: delicate, mild, etc. Some translators of the New Testament take it here to mean the passive partner in male homoerotic acts, but that is an unwarranted supposition.\n\u201cPrecisely what an\xa0arsenokoites is has long been a matter of speculation and argument. Literally, it means a man who \u201cbeds\u201d \u2013 that is, \u201ccouples with\u201d \u2013 \u201cmales.\u201d But, there is no evidence of its use before Paul\u2019s text.\n\u201c\u2026It would not mean \u201chomosexual\u201d in the modern sense of a person of a specific erotic disposition, for the simple reason that the ancient world possessed no comparable concept of a specifically homoerotic sexual identity; it would refer to a particular sexual behavior, but we cannot say exactly which one.\u201d\nBentley Hart goes on to mention that the Clementine Vulgate interprets the word \u201carsenokoitai\u201d as those who use male concubines [prostitutes] and that Luther\u2019s German Bible interprets the word as referring to paedophiles.\n\n\nFurther, he says:\n\u201cMy guess at the proper connotation of the word is based simply upon the reality that in the first century the most common and readily available form of male homoerotic sexual activity was a master\u2019s or patron\u2019s exploitation of young male slaves.\u201d\n\n\nSo, when we read the word \u201cHomosexuality\u201d in our English New Testament Bibles, we need to remember that this is not what Paul had in mind when he wrote those words that are \u2013 today \u2013 translated as such.\nWhat he meant, most likely, was\xa0either those who sexually abuse young boys, or those who engaged in pagan temple sex rituals.\nWhat\u2019s more, when Paul used the term \u201cmalakos\u201d \u2013 which simply means \u201ceffeminate\u201d \u2013 he was referring to men who shaved their beards or grew long hair, or who otherwise acted in a manner that could be culturally interpreted as being \u201cunmanly.\u201d\nBut, hopefully, none of us today would agree with Paul\u2019s conviction that a man who shaves his beard or has long hair will not enter the Kingdom of God. Rather, we should place that statement in the same basket with a few of Paul\u2019s other statements [in the very same Corinthian epistle] that women should cover their heads when they pray or that everyone should greet one another with a holy kiss. These are cultural norms that Paul could ask those first century Corinthians to observe, but that we, living in the 21st Century, are free to disregard.\n\n\nIf we do this for head-coverings and holy kisses, we should feel no shame doing so for men who shave their beards or wear long hair.\n[For more on this, read \u201cThe Abomination of a Close Shave\u201d]\nThe bottom line is this: We have made this issue \u2013 homosexuality \u2013 one of the main tenets of the Christian faith. As if Jesus and the Apostles did little more than argue the subject day and night. [Of course, they never mention it at all].\nBut, because of this distortion of the Gospel by modern American Christians, many\xa0actually believe that they cannot preach the Gospel because they are being persecuted whenever they speak out against homosexuality. They point to legislation that forbids hate speech against the LGBTQ community and quake with fear because they believe this means that very soon Bibles will be confiscated and pastors arrested in the pulpits for \u201cpreaching the Word of God\u201d or \u201cstanding for the truth of the Gospel.\u201d\nEven though the Christian church has been preaching and living out the Gospel for nearly 2,000 years without mentioning homosexuality specifically. [With a few exceptions along the way, of course].\n\n\nThis argument about what is, or is not, a sin is a distraction. Worse, it\u2019s an unnecessary pivot from loving others as Christ has loved us to pursue the condemnation of a certain group of people who deserve nothing but love and acceptance.\nThe Gospel is that \u201cGod was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting men\u2019s sins against them.\u201d [2 Cor. 5:19]\nWe have been given this ministry of reconciliation.

141,The Aikido Spirit of God,"June 1, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Aikido, it\u2019s a style of martial arts that uses an opponent\u2019s energy against them to redirect their kinetic force to turn it back upon them.\nOr, as the Wikipedia entry explains:\xa0Aikido\u2019s techniques include\xa0irimi\xa0(entering), and\xa0tenkan\xa0(turning) movements that redirect the opponent\u2019s attack\xa0momentum.\n\n\nThe man who invented this style of martial arts created for one purpose: \u201cto create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury\u201d.\nThis is exactly what God does.\nConsider that God never wanted anyone to rule His people other than Himself. God wanted a people who would look to Him as their King. But, unfortunately, His people wanted \u201ca King like all the other nations have\u201d and even though He was grieved by their choice, He gave them what they asked for.\nAfter giving them a King, God told them that He would send them a Messiah who would rule on David\u2019s throne forever. But notice, it was never God\u2019s desire for King David to have any throne at all. Yet, God used the disobedience and rejection of His people and redirected it to the Messiah to come.\nGod also never asked anyone to build Him a temple. When King David set out to build one for God, His response was: \u201cHeaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me?\u201d and then promises that, instead, God will build a house for David which, again, is a nod to the coming Messiah who would build a Temple not made with human hands but from human hearts that are surrendered to God [the Ekklesia where God lives by His Spirit \u2013 the Church].\n\n\nSo, once again, God takes our mistakes and turns them around to bless us anyway.\nAs Joseph told his brothers who had sold him into slavery out of jealousy: \u201cWhat you intended for evil, God meant for good.\u201d\nThis is the Aikido way of God.\nAnother example of this is animal sacrifice.\nMoses knew of no other way to worship a god [any god] other than a blood sacrifice. There simply wasn\u2019t any other form of worship known to mankind in that ancient world. So, Moses assumes that to worship Yahweh, something must be slain on an altar to please God.\nBut, according to Jeremiah, God never wanted animal sacrifices in the first place:\n\u201cFor I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.\xa0But this is what I commanded them, saying,\xa0\u2018Obey My voice, and\xa0I will be your God, and you shall be My people. And walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you.\u2019\xa0Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but\xa0followed\xa0the counsels\xa0and\xa0the\xa0dictates of their evil hearts, and\xa0went\xa0backward and not forward.\u201d [Jeremiah 7:22-24]\n\n\n\n\nAgain, God did not want animal sacrifices. Moses did.\nBut, God allowed this to be practiced in spite of this and, instead, used this misunderstanding to point to Christ who would come and fulfill this picture of the scapegoat and redeem the barbaric practice of sacrifice to liberate us from the bondage of guilt and sin.\nThis is why Jesus echoes the prophet Hosea and says:\n\u201cGo and learn what this means, \u2018I desire mercy, not sacrifice.\u201d [Matt 9:13; 12:7]\nGod is always taking our disobedience, our misunderstandings, our limited vision, even our total rejection of Him, to redirect it back around to bless us and redeem us and draw us nearer to Himself.\nGod uses everything \u2013 all wisdom, all knowledge, all ignorance, all disobedience, all rejection, all striving \u2013 to declare His love to us and to set us free from everything that entangles us.\nThis is who God is. This is who God has always been.

142,Christ Is Our Authority [Not The Bible],"May 31, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\u201cWhen [LGBTQ-affirming Christians] tell me that I am wrong for saying that [homosexuality] is a sin, in the simplicity of my faith in the Holy Scriptures, I point him to this sacred record [the Bible], and tell him, in all candor, as my text does, that his teaching blasphemes the name of God and His doctrine.\n\n\n\u201cThe tree of [affirming homosexuality and transgenderism] is evil and only evil\u2026[it] is nourished by an utter rejection of the Scriptures.\u201d\xa0\u2013 Rev. Henry Van Dyke\nMany\xa0Christians today would agree wholeheartedly with Pastor Van Dyke\u2019s statements here. But keep in mind that what he was actually defending here was slavery and his opponents were Abolitionists. Still, his position in favor of slave-holding was very strongly supported by the Holy Scriptures. One cannot deny that he was right about the fact that the Bible did not condemn slaveholding outright.\nBut we cannot miss the point that it is more than possible for someone to be Biblically-correct about something and still be very, very wrong at the same time.\nThe struggle for many of us is that we have been told for so long that we need to be \u201cBiblically-minded\u201d that we have forgotten that this same Bible teaches us to listen to the voice of the Good Shepherd and affirms that we have the mind of Christ.\nFurthermore, the same Bible also teaches us to love extravagantly \u2013 as Christ has loved us \u2013 which was unconditionally and before we did anything to change our minds about Him, or how we live.\n\n\nHere are Van Dyke\u2019s actual comments about Abolitionists made in 1860:\n\u201cThe tree of Abolition is evil and only evil\u2026[it] is nourished by an utter rejection of the Scriptures\u2026.When the Abolitionist tells me that slaveholding is sin, in the simplicity of my faith in the Holy Scriptures, I point him to this sacred record, and tell him, in all candor, as my text does, that his teaching blasphemes the name of God and His doctrine.\u201d-\u2013 Rev. Henry Van Dyke (1860), \u201cThe Character and Influence of Abolitionism\u201d (sermon), p.11.\nNow, listen to what pro-slavery Christians said in the 1800\u2019s about Abolitionists and substitute the topic of homosexuality and you\u2019ll see that the arguments used today are exactly the same:\n\u201c[Opponents of slavery] decide a priori [in advance] what the Bible ought to speak, and then turn it over in order to see how they can make it speak what they wish\u2026When Moses speaks the words of the God of the Hebrews, it is for us to listen, not to call into question.\u201d\xa0\u2013 Bernard Whitman (1831), Two Letters to the Rev. Moses Stuart: On the Subject of Religious Liberty\u201d, p. 30-42.\n\n\n\u201cIf the present course of the abolitionists is right, then the course of Christ and the apostles were wrong.\u201d\xa0\u2013 Charles Hodge (1860), \u201cBible Argument on Slavery\u201d in E.N. Elliott\u2019s \u201cCotton Is King\u201d, p. 849.\n\u201cThe tree of Abolition is evil and only evil\u2026[it] is nourished by an utter rejection of the Scriptures.\u201d\xa0\u2013 Rev. Henry Van Dyke (1860), \u201cThe Character and Influence of Abolitionism\u201d (sermon), p.11.\n\u201cThose who oppose slavery are engaged in willful or conscious opposition to the truth\u2026Who are we, that in our modern wisdom presume to set aside the Word of God, and\u2026invent for ourselves a \u2018higher law\u2019 that those holy Scriptures which are given to us as \u2018a light to our feet and a lamp to our paths\u2019 must answer?\u201d\u2013 \xa0Episcopal Bishop John Henry Hopkins (1864), \u201cScriptural, Ecclesiastical, and Historical View of Slavery.\u201d, p.16\n\n\nThose who opposed slavery [the Abolitionists] had very little scriptural support for their position, but they were on the side of Christ all the same.\nWhy is it so hard for us today to see that there are times when we need to listen to the mind of Christ and the voice of the Good Shepherd in order to fulfill the law of love?\n\n\nAs Henry Brinton said recently:\n\u201cAn answer based only on Biblical quotations may put us on the side of Southern theologians who supported slavery and lost their way.\u201d\xa0[Quoted from CNN, Oct. 15, 2014] [John Blake, \u201cHow the Bible Was Used To Justify Slavery, Abolitionism.\u201d]\nSometimes, to obey Jesus we might have to admit that the Bible falls short. In those cases, we must cling tightly to the Good Shepherd and remember His command:\n\u201cLove one another as I have loved you.\u201d \u2013\xa0Jesus\nToday, almost no Christian would argue in favor of slavery, in spite of the fact that it is quite \u201cBiblical.\u201d\nSo, the question of \u201cauthority\u201d immediately comes to mind. Some argue for the inerrant and infallible authority of Scripture as the rule for a Christian\u2019s life. But others, like me, suggest instead that our authority is Christ and that it is still the Holy Spirit who cries out to the Body of Christ today.\nSadly, many of us will not, or cannot, listen because we are convinced that our Bibles \u2013 and only our Bibles \u2013 have authority over us.\n\n\nAre we willing to submit ourselves to the Holy Spirit? Are we courageous enough to allow Jesus to be our guide?\nKeep in mind that the Bible never holds itself up as our final authority. Instead, the Bible points us to Jesus and reminds us that He is the Head of the Church.\nIn the words of our Abba Father who thundered from heaven,\xa0\u201cThis is my Son.

143,Is the Bible Inspired?,"May 30, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nWhat do we mean when we say that something is \u201cinspired\u201d?\n\xa0\n\nFor example, if I hear a song on the radio and I respond by saying that it was \u201cinspired\u201d what I mean is that I believe the song had a spiritual quality to it that enabled the God of the Universe to reveal something of truth or beauty [or both] to me through the words and melody of the song.\n\n\nIt\u2019s the same for me if I view a magnificent work of art in a museum, or watch a film that transcends mere storytelling to communicate something deeper and more profound than perhaps even the screenwriter, director or actors intended.\nBut, does this \u201cinspiration\u201d suggest that God wrote that song, or penned that screenplay? No, of course not. Do I mean that God sang those notes or acted that scene? No, that would be silly.\nI would also not mean that the \u201cinspired\u201d song or film or work of art was infallible or inerrant. Those terms would make no sense in relation to that song, or poem, or film, or painting, or sculpture.\nWhen something is inspired, it is infused with truth and beauty and profound wisdom. It is an elemental conduit for the Divine to speak into our souls in a way that we might not otherwise be aware of, or open to.\nThis is what it means to say something is \u201cinspired\u201d.\nSo, why do we come to this book we call the Bible and apply totally different meanings to the term \u201cinspiration\u201d?\nSure, we all acknowledge that the Bible is filled with Truth about who God is and what God is like. We often marvel at the artistry and the beauty of the words, and we admire the elegance of the truth we find in its stories. We weep at the passion of Christ and then we weep again at His resurrection. We are moved by these words and inspired by these ideas of God\u2019s boundless love for us that is higher, wider, longer and deeper than we can imagine. We are reassured to know that nothing can ever separate us from this unbreakable love and that Christ will never leave us, nor forsake us.\n\n\nBut, why then do we take that unnecessary step of saying that God wrote those words? Why do we insist that those words are infallible or inerrant? Why do we refuse to admit that there are errors, and mistakes, and contradictions all through it?\nThose flaws only add to the humanity of these testimonies. God is perfect, but we are not. God is infallible, but we sometimes get it wrong.\n\n\nSomehow, we have made the Scriptures the point of the story. But the Scriptures never point to the Scriptures. The Scriptures always point us to Christ.\nTo fail to see this, or to follow this intended path, will lead us to ruin. Why? Because a book cannot save you. A Bible cannot change you. A collection of stories and songs and poems and prophecies will never transform you into the image of Christ.\nBut if we can follow this map to its intended destination, we will be healed, and changed, and forever transformed.\nThere is no life in the Bible. Jesus said so.\nThere is only life in Christ.\nFollow the map to the mark on the page. It all points us to Jesus. Knowing Him is not only possible without the Bible, it\u2019s absolutely essential for an actual relationship with a living God.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

144,Abortion Is Biblical [But Not Christlike],"May 25, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nAs I have tried to point out several times, there is a huge difference between being \u201cBiblical\u201d and being \u201cChristlike\u201d.\nIf we cling to the Bible and advocate for a more Biblical worldview, this leaves us open to a host of \u201cBiblical\u201d ideas like slavery, patriarchy, genocide, polygamy and abortion.\nYes, even abortion is a Biblical principle.\n\n\n\nHere are two examples of how the Bible allows for \u2013 and often even commands \u2013\xa0 abortions:\nFirst, in Numbers 5:11-31 there is a very detailed procedure for a husband to determine if his wife has been unfaithful to him. If she gets pregnant from intercourse with another man, the husband can uncover this by taking his wife to the priest who is then instructed by God (?) to give the woman a potion to drink. If the woman was unfaithful, then her baby will miscarry. If she is faithful, then the baby and the mother will both be spared.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from this section of Numbers chapter 5:\n\u201cBut if you have gone astray\xa0while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband\u201d\u2014\xa0here the priest is to put the woman under this curse\u2014\u201cmay the\xa0Lord\xa0cause you to become a curse\xa0among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell.\xa0May this water\xa0that brings a curse\xa0enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.\u201d [v. 20-22]\n\n\nThis is a very Biblical procedure for inducing an abortion for reasons of unfaithfulness or adultery.\nAnother Biblical endorsement of abortion is found in Hosea 9:14 where God tells the prophet that He will give the rebellious people of Ephraim \u201cwombs that miscarry\u201d [and the word used here is the Hebrew \u201cshacol\u201c which denotes abortion or miscarriage].\n\u201cGive them,\xa0Lord\u2014what will you give them?\xa0Give them wombs that miscarry\xa0and breasts that are dry.\u201d [Hosea 9:14]\nLater in the same chapter, should there be any doubt about what God [?] apparently intends here, the Lord says:\n\u201cEven if they bear children,\xa0I will slay\xa0their cherished offspring.\u201d [v. 16]\nDo we honestly believe that God is in the abortion business? Does God, who is love, actively abort children to punish us? Does God actually provide us with an abortion procedure as a way to determine a wife\u2019s faithfulness?\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think so.\nOther verses that also suggest that God does not count an unborn life as being equal to that of a person outside of the womb is in Exodus 21:21-23 where specific punishment is described for the man who causes a woman to miscarry her child: He should pay fine. So, if the life of the unborn child were equal to the life of a someone who was born, then the \u201ceye for an eye\u201d rule should demand that the man who caused the unborn child to die should also be put to death, or that one of his own children should be put to death. But instead, only a fine is to paid to the man who lost the child.\nAll of these examples are Biblical. All of them allow for abortion to be acceptable in the eyes of God.\nHowever, none of these are Christlike.\nThose who follow Jesus know that God\u2019s love extends to every human being \u2013 whether born or unborn.\nOur choice is simple: We take a Biblical approach [and then accept the Biblical teaching that abortion is not murder], or we take a Christlike approach [and we follow the ethics of Jesus who has given us the law of love to follow].\nI can\u2019t speak for you or anyone else, but I don\u2019t want a more Biblical world. I want a more Christlike one.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

145,All The Writings Are God-Breathed,"May 24, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nStop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: \u201cAll Scripture is God\u2013breathed\xa0and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,\xa0so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\u201d\nThat\u2019s probably the most commonly-quoted verse from the New Testament whenever anyone questions the accuracy or truthfulness of what we read in the Bible.\n\n\nIt\u2019s found in 2 Timothy 3:16-17 [an epistle which many Bible scholars admit was most-likely not actually written by the Apostle Paul], and what it says \u2013 and what it really means \u2013 are two entirely different things.\nFor example: When Paul [or Pseudo-Paul] wrote this sentence, it\u2019s highly unlikely that what they had in mind was the book that most Protestants today refer to as \u201cThe Bible\u201d. The Biblical Canon of Paul\u2019s day wasn\u2019t exactly the same as our own.\nPlus, it\u2019s also very unlikely that \u201cPaul\u201d was thinking of his own letters as \u201cScripture\u201d in any way, shape or form. These were letters written to encourage other believers who were struggling with various challenges that he wanted to address. That\u2019s all.\nStill, the verse above does say: \u201cAll Scripture is God-breathed\u2026\u201d. Or, does it?**\nActually, no. That\u2019s not what the verse actually says.\nYes, in your English translations of that verse you will find the phrase \u201cAll Scripture is God-breathed\u2026\u201d, but in the Greek the word rendered as \u201cScripture\u201d is simply the common word for \u201cwritings\u201d [graphia].\n\n\nSo, what this verse actually says is: \u201cAll the God-breathed writings are useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,\xa0so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\u201d\nIn other words: Everything is inspired by God and can be useful for our spiritual growth, enlightenment, and development as followers of Christ.\nAs an example: When Paul goes to Athens and sees the idol to the \u201cUnknown God\u201d, he stands before the pagan unbelievers and declares that Christ has fulfilled their scriptures [or their \u201cwritings\u201d] about a God who is unknown to them. He even quotes their own prophets and poets to show how Christ has fulfilled what was written.\nSo, what if what is really meant by this verse is that Christ is the fulfillment of every scripture, whether Jewish, or Pagan, or Hindu, or Buddhist, etc.?\nIn other words, if Jesus is the \u201cWay, the Truth and the Life\u201d, then we can expect to see Christ in all truth, and in all ways, and in every life.\nThis means we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that the Hindu Vedas [scriptures] teach something like this:\n\n\n\u201cGod Himself is the sacrifice\u201d [Satpatha Brahmanam] and In Tandya Maha Brahmanam of Sama Veda that \u201cGod would offer Himself as a sacrifice and obtain atonement for sins\u201d.\n\u201cThe word is the indestructible God.\u201d (Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 4:1, 2).\nThe Hindu scriptures also highlight the physical suffering of Christ. [NOTE: There was no Hindu god or goddess who bore such suffering on behalf of sinners]:\n\u201cThe sacrificial victim is to be crowned with a crown made of thorny vines\u201d (Rigveda 10.90.7, 15)\n\u201cAfter death, His clothes are to be divided among the offerors\u201d (Ithareya Brahmanam)\n\u201cHis hands and legs are to be bound to a yoopa (a wooden pole) causing blood shed\u201d (Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, 3.9.28)\n\u201cBefore death, He should be given a drink of somarasa\u201d [an intoxicating herbal juice] (Yajur Veda 31).\n\u201cNone of His bones will be broken\u201d (Ithareya Brahmanam 2.6).\n\n\nIt should not surprise us in the least to learn that Buddha taught something very similar to what Jesus taught about loving our enemies, turning the other cheek, or treating others as we want to be treated.\n\n\nWhy? Because all truth is God\u2019s truth and because all the writings are \u201cGod-breathed\u201d, not just the Jewish writings, or the Pagan writings, but \u201call writings are profitable to us for teaching, instruction and wisdom.\u201d\nChrist fulfills the Scriptures \u2013 all of the Scriptures.\nThis does not diminish the Bible. It magnifies Christ above the Bible and above every Holy Book ever written.\nChrist has not only accomplished everything in the Law and the Prophets, as he promised to do, He also accomplished what was written and promised in all the writings.\nTherefore, all the writings can point us to Christ. All the God-breathed writings are profitable for us.\nAs long as our eyes are set on Christ, and our relationship is with Him [and not any book or man-made religion], we can learn to see and to know Christ as He has been revealed and illuminated to us, regardless of the source.\nWhat do you think?\nNOTE: Special thanks to my dear friend, Chuck McKnight, who pointed out to me that the word for \u201cScripture\u201d in 2 Timothy 3:16 is actually the simple Greek word for \u201cwritings\u201d [graphia] and inspired this post.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

146,How the Holy Spirit Leads Us,"May 23, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nOver the weekend I spoke at a conference in Seattle, Washington area that focused on \u201cJesus, the Bible and the Holy Spirit\u201d and during an informal discussion on our final morning together, one of the participants asked a question about the Holy Spirit. His question was about how we engage with the Holy Spirit and how the Spirit leads and interacts with us in both an individual and a corporate sense.\n\n\nHere\u2019s my response:\nFirst of all, I would say that everyone is capable of being led by the Holy Spirit. The only real question is, \u201cHow much are you open to being led by the Holy Spirit?\u201d\nIn other words, we can be led by the Spirit as much as we like, and our experiences with the Spirit are limited only by our own willingness and desire to be led.\nSome of us are skeptical of the Spirit\u2019s ability to speak to us or to lead us. Those people will be prevented from ever experiencing the Spirit due to their own inability to accept the possibility of being led by the Spirit.\nOthers are afraid of releasing themselves to the Holy Spirit. They would no sooner relinquish control of their life to the Spirit than they would let go of the steering wheel of their car while it was going 85 mph down the freeway. Why? Because they are fearful of what it would feel like to be out of control.\nThis is honestly a bit laughable to me now. [At one point, I was completely in agreement with this feeling, but now I have changed my perspective]. The reality is: God loves us. God wants nothing but the best for us. To surrender control of our lives to the Spirit of God is the best \u2013 and the safest \u2013 place we could possibly be.\n\n\nThe only real danger we might face is simply this: God might not do things our way.\nThis is what most of us are too afraid to risk.\nBut, once we really trust that God is good and that God loves us, then we have an opportunity to allow the Holy Spirit to lead us. Once we begin to experience the leadership of the Holy Spirit, it becomes easier and more natural for us to let go and trust God.\nYou and I can experience as much of the Spirit as we are open to receiving or experiencing.\nThis is often expressed in us and through us in a variety of ways. Paul mentions several different types of what we would term \u201cgifts of the Holy Spirit\u201d, but in a very natural way they are usually classified as:\n*Hearing God\u2019s Voice. \nThis can take a variety of forms like:\n-Words of Wisdom [Where you know what to do in a certain situation that defies logic]\n-Words of Knowledge [Where you\xa0know things supernaturally that you didn\u2019t learn on your own]\n-Words of Encouragement [Where you hear something spoken in your heart that is intended to encourage another person]\n-Words of Life [Where you literally speak words to people that they need to live and to think in new ways]\n\n\n*Receiving Gifts.\nThis can be expressed as:\n-Teaching [Where you simplify and explain spiritual truths in practical ways]\n-Tongues [Where you speak a language not your own to point others to Christ, or to pray to God in a heavenly language]\n-Discernment [Where you understand the meaning of things that are not obvious to others]\n-Healing [Where you pray and receive a miraculous answer that reverses an illness, sickness or injury]\n*Being Sent.\n-Loving [Where you supernaturally receive God\u2019s heart for everyone around you]\n-Serving [Where you spontaneously respond to the needs of others proactively and with joy]\n-Giving [Where you eagerly share your resources with people who have not been blessed as you have been]\n-Hospitality/Sharing [Where your generosity overflows in the form of welcoming people into your home and your property is freely given away to bless others]\nThe second half of the question that was asked dealt with how we can experience the Spirit in community. This is a key component of the entire idea.\n\n\nKeep in mind: God is relational. To be even more specific, God is community. The Trinity is an everlasting love affair between Father, Son and Holy Spirit. They love one another. They submit to one another. They point to one another. They humble themselves and defer to one another. We are invited into this synergy of love and affection.\n\n\nSo, the Father glorifies the Son. The Son only points to the Father. The Spirit points to the Son. The Son goes away so that the Spirit can take His place and then the Spirit shows up and points us back to the Son, who glorifies the Father\u2026who exalts the Son\u2026who sends the Spirit\u2026.etc.\nThis is what our ekklesia [or our gatherings together] should look like.\nPaul alludes to this when he sketches out the Body of Christ for us in 1 Cor. 12. This is where we see everyone [that\u2019s us] receiving different and unique gifts that are from the Spirit but intended to allow us to be a blessing to one another. Everyone\u2019s gift is not for building themselves up. The gifts are all for building everyone else up.\nAs we all use our gifts to come under one another and bless each other, Christ is directing us [as the Head of the Body], and we are all growing nearer to Him and learning to submit ourselves more and more to His loving thoughts about us and our brothers and sisters.\nHowever, this only works in a room full of people who are individually submitted to the leadership of the Holy Spirit. If we are resisting the Holy Spirit in our personal lives [out of fear or out of doubt], then we will never know what it\u2019s like to be in a room where Christ is the Head and everyone in the gathering is using their gifts to bless one another in love.\n\n\nThis is why being led by the Holy Spirit is essential to the life of the Body of Christ.\nSadly, many of us never experience this intended reality. We settle for a sermon and a song.\nBut, we don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s very possible for us to actually live out this Spirit-led reality today.\nHow do I know? Because I\u2019ve been doing it for over 11 years now.\nMany others have tasted this reality too.\nIf you\u2019re interested, I\u2019d love to help you start a gathering like this. Or, just get together with some friends and start learning to collaborate together on allowing the Spirit of God to lead your life and then the life of the Body of Christ in your area. [You don\u2019t need my help to do this].\nIf you\u2019ve experienced a gathering like this, please share your experiences in the comments below.

147,Why Knowing Jesus Outside the Bible Is What the Bible Is All About,"May 22, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nOver the weekend I spend 3 days debating \u201cJesus, the Bible and the Holy Spirit\u201d with a few dozen other people in the forest outside of Seattle, Washington.\nImage: Keith Giles and Chuck McKnight\nSeveral of the other speakers at this conference maintained that the Bible was the only possible way for anyone to know who Jesus is. Why? Because, as one of them put it: \u201cEverything I know about Jesus came from the Bible. I\u2019ve never heard God\u2019s audible voice. I can\u2019t have a seance to contact Jesus. So, the Bible is how God speaks and how I know who Jesus is.\u201d\n\n\nSo, to put it another way: \u201cMy experience with Jesus comes from a book. Therefore, I trust my experience with a book rather than trusting in other experiences without a book.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the irony: Christians argue that the Bible is the only way to know Christ because that is their experience. So, they are basing their argument against trusting in our experience on their experience of trusting a Bible [which encourages us to experience Christ].\nIsn\u2019t that weird?\nThink about this: Right now there are dozens of stories coming from Muslims in the Middle East about how Jesus is appearing to them in visions and dreams. Because of this, many of them are turning to Christ.\nIs this really happening? I believe it could be true. But, even if it\u2019s not, several of these same people at the conference I just attended do believe it\u2019s real. At least twice I heard people referring to these Muslims who are having visions of Jesus and turning to faith in Christ.\nNow, let\u2019s think about this for a second. Imagine going to the Middle East ten years from now and entering a Church filled with former Muslims who all came to Christ after seeing Jesus in a vision or a dream. What would they say if you asked them, \u201cWhat\u2019s the main way that Jesus speaks to us today?\u201d or \u201cHow can we know anything about Jesus?\u201d what would you think they\u2019d say?\n\n\nIf their experiences of coming to Christ were all based on a vision or a dream, then we should expect them to answer, \u201cVisions and dreams are the primary way God communicates to us today. I wouldn\u2019t even be a Christian or know anything at all about Jesus if it weren\u2019t for dreams and visions. Sure, the Bible is great! But everything I know about Jesus came through an actual encounter with Jesus.\u201d\nSee? That\u2019s the problem. We tend to limit everyone\u2019s experience or encounter with God based on our own experience or encounter. If we primarily came to Christ by reading a book [or by being taught from a book], then we will become convinced that the book is the best and only way to know anything about God.\nBut, if we primarily come to know Christ by encountering him personally through a dream or a vision, we\u2019re likely to become convinced that experiences from God are best [and only?] way to know God.\nOf course, our faith in Christ is about so much more than knowledge of God. It\u2019s not about gathering information about God. Our faith in Christ is supposed to be based on a relationship with the Divine.\nGod, in Christ, has come near. This is what \u201cEmmanuel\u201d means. \u201cGod with us\u201d is one of the names of Jesus. He is with us right now.\n\n\n\n\nJesus emphasized that eternal life was defined by our intimate \u201cknowing\u201d of God in a way that births new life, the way an intimate encounter between a man and a woman conceives something brand new within.\nTry to keep in mind:\nThe Word of God is not a book. The Word of God is Jesus.\nThe Word of God speaks to you. The Bible is silent.\nThe Word of God lives within you. The Bible is not alive.\nThe Word of God will never leave you. The Bible can be misplaced.\nThe Word of God suffered and died on a cross. The Bible isn\u2019t breathing.\nThe Word of God loves you. The Bible doesn\u2019t love anyone.\nIf we\u2019re going to read the Bible, let\u2019s actually pay attention to what it teaches. The Bible never points us to itself. The Bible points us to Christ. The Bible also teaches that we can \u2013 and should \u2013 experience God for ourselves.\nThe Bible also teaches us to listen to the voice of God and learn to follow the Holy Spirit who leads us into all truth.\nYou can know Christ through your Bible, yes. But you can also know Christ the way you know an actual person. You can experience Christ, right now. You can hear His voice. You can know His thoughts. You can experience His love. You can know His peace.\n\n\nI invite you to move beyond the Bible to experience Jesus for yourself. So does the Bible.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

148,America\u2019s Abomination That Caused Desolations,"May 16, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nWhen the President of the United States, under the leadership of his Dispensationalist Christian Vice President and his End Times Obsessed Secretary of State, declares Jerusalem the capital of Israel and invites one notoriously Christian Zionist Televangelist and one infamously anti-Jewish Christian Pastor to speak at the dedication ceremony for the new US Embassy in that city, you might be wise to ask a few questions.\n\n\nLike, why is the guy who said Jewish people were going to burn in hell up there? Why is this move in any way a step in the right direction? Why did Israel shoot 61 unarmed people dead the same day? Why didn\u2019t the US Government condemn this violence?\nHere\u2019s the fact: Toxic Dispensationalism, Nationalism, and Zionism are ruling American politics and the Church. What could go wrong?\nA lot.\nFor one thing, Evangelical Christians could be deluded into thinking that somehow God is very pleased with all of this. [He isn\u2019t]\nThey could start to think that when they read about Israel in their Bible that it\u2019s referring to the same Israel where their country just opened a new Embassy. [It\u2019s not]\nThey might start to believe that all of this moves us one step closer to the prophesied Second Coming of Jesus. [It does not]\nThey might also start to believe that God loves America, and the secular nation of Israel, more than Palestine, and Iran, and North Korea. [But that\u2019s not true]\nAmerican Christians might also start to believe that God gave that land to the Jewish people. But, according to God, He did not give land to anyone. God said:\n\n\n\u201cThe land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers.\u201d \u2013 [Lev. 25:23]\nThe Apostle Paul told us that every promise made to Abraham was not made to his descendants, but to Christ:\n\u201cNow the promises were made to Abraham and to his seed. It does not say, \u201cAnd to seeds,\u201d referring to many, but referring to one, \u201cAnd to your seed,\u201d who is Christ.\u201d \u2013 [Galatians 3:16]\nHere\u2019s the deal: When God promised the land to Abraham, it was so that Abraham and his Seed, could be a blessing to all nations. Christ is the fulfillment of that promise. Through Christ, all the nations of the earth are blessed. His Kingdom is made up of people from every tribe, and tongue, and nation.\nIn Christ, there is no longer any Jew or Gentile. All are one in Christ.\nThis means that when the most powerful Empire in the history of our planet seeks to favor one people group over another and turns a blind eye to the oppression of millions of people \u2013 many of whom are followers of Christ \u2013 it\u2019s not pleasing to God. In fact, it\u2019s Anti-Christ.\nBecause God is not for Israel. He is for people who live in Israel. God is not for Palestine. He is for people who live in that place. God is not for America. He is for people who were born there.\n\n\n\n\nOr, as the prophet Isaiah phrased it:\n\u201cAll the nations are as nothing before him, they are accounted by him as less than nothing and worthless.\u201d [Isaiah 40:17]\nSo, God is not for tribalism or nationalism. God is not for \u201cthem\u201d, because to God there is no \u201cthem\u201d. There is only us.\nThat means God is for everyone.\nBesides, as a follower of Jesus, if you can\u2019t imagine what it would be like if your own son or daughter, or husband or wife, or mother or father, were one of those 61 people shot dead in Palestine during a peaceful protest, then you might not understand what Jesus means when He says, \u201cWhatever you have done to the least of these, you have done it unto me.\u201d\nLet\u2019s crucify our politics and our nationalism. Our God does not take sides. We are either on His side, or we are on our own.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God From the Bible\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d, and\xa0co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

149,What\u2019s Happening In Israel Isn\u2019t About Jesus,"May 16, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nWhen American Televangelists like John Hagee and Robert Jeffress stand in Jerusalem and proclaim that Biblical prophecy is being fulfilled, it\u2019s important to realize that there is no such Biblical prophecy being fulfilled.\nNone.\nEvery Old Testament prophecy about Israel returning to the land was fulfilled.\n\n\nThe final prophecy about the fate of Israel and the destruction of Jerusalem was spoken by Jesus and fulfilled in AD 70. There were no prophecies made after that time about any restoration of Jerusalem or rebuilding of the Temple.\nOn the contrary, there were dozens of prophecies and statements in the New Testament by Jesus and the Apostles about the new Temple of God being fulfilled in Christ, and subsequently by those who are in Christ.\nThe new Temple of God is us.\n\u201cAs you come to him, the living Stone\u2014rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him\u2014 you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\u201d \u2013 1 Peter 2:4-5\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that you yourselves are God\u2019s temple and that God\u2019s Spirit lives in you?\u201d 1 Cor 3:16\n\u201cDo you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own.\u201d 1 Cor 6:19\n\u201cWhat agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: \u201cI will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.\u201d 2 Cor 6:16\n\n\n\u201cConsequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God\u2019s people and members of God\u2019s household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him, you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.\u201d \u2013 Eph 2:19-22\nIn fact, there IS one verse in Revelation about the fact that there is NO Temple whatsoever in Jerusalem:\n\u201cAnd I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And they city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and her gates will never be shut by day \u2013 and there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb\u2019s book of life.\u201d [Rev. 21:22-27]\n\n\nSo, we are the Temple of God, and at the same time, Christ is our Temple. These are not made by human hands but are made of flesh and bone. The Temple is made of living stones, not brick and mortar.\n\n\nJesus abides within us, and we abide within Him. We are the living Temple of the Holy Spirit where Christ lives, and Christ is the living Temple where all of us \u201clive and move and have our being.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s happening right now in Jerusalem, and in Palestine is sad, and tragic. It is totally man-made. God has nothing to do with the posturing, the nationalism, the violence, the genocide, or the fear-mongering.\nAmerican Christians have a choice: They can follow Dispensational doctrines cooked up by John Darby in 1830, or they can follow Christ.\nChrist does not rejoice over the death of anyone. Christ does not celebrate the murder of innocents. Christ does not revel in the oppressive power of Empire.\nIn Christ\u2019s Kingdom, everyone is loved. No one is excluded. Those national identities are meaningless. Everyone is simply a child of the Father and a brother or sister who deserves to be loved, fed, comforted, and embraced into the Family of God.\n\n\nIn Christ, there is no Jew or Gentile, Male or Female, Slave or Free. In Christ, we are all one people.\nJesus is not waiting for anything to happen in the Middle East. He has already accomplished everything necessary for everlasting peace. He has shown us how to love, and to forgive one another. He empowers us and inspires us to love God, and love others, in this same extravagant way.\n\u201cAnd I heard another voice from heaven saying, \u201cCome out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.\xa0For her sins have reached\xa0to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.\xa0\u201d (Rev. 18:4-8)\nAs for me and my house, we will follow Jesus.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: Liberating the Word of God From the Bible\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018.\nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d, and\xa0co-hosts the\xa0Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\xa0on iTunes and Podbean.

150,What Is The Greatest Sin Of All?,"May 10, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t really like focusing too much on sin. Not because I deny that people struggle with sin, but because I think our focus should be on Jesus \u2013 the solution for our sin \u2013 rather than on the problem.\nHowever, someone asked me recently about sin and started suggesting that some sins are worse than others. Ultimately, the conversation turned to the question: \u201cWhat is the greatest sin of all?\u201d\n\n\nFor some, the greatest sin is homosexuality or being transgender. For other Christians, it\u2019s abortion or voting Democrat. For still others, the greatest sin is to believe the wrong things about God. [Because, for them, Christianity is about being \u201cright\u201d and therefore if the Gospel is about information, then the greatest sin is to have the wrong information about God].\nBut I reject all of those notions about sin. I don\u2019t believe that any of these sins [and most of them aren\u2019t even really \u201csins\u201d at all], qualify as the greatest sin.\nWhy? Simply because sin, by definition, means \u201cto miss the mark\u201d. For the longest time, this was defined by breaking the Law \u2013 literally the \u201cTen Commandments\u201d given by Moses to the Israelites \u2013 as a sign of the Old Covenant.\nHowever, those laws are obsolete today because that Covenant is obsolete. [See Hebrews 8:13 and my previous blog post on this subject.] God has given us a New Covenant, and Jesus has given us a New Command [just one].\n\u201cA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, you must also love one another.\u201d \u2013 Jesus, [John 13:34]\n\n\nSo, if the command Jesus gave us was to love one another extravagantly [as He loved us], then the greatest sin is to live without love.\nEven if you don\u2019t accept my thesis that the Old Covenant Law is obsolete, my conclusion is still true. Because Jesus also said that the entire law could be summed up in the \u201cGreat Commandment\u201d which is \u201cTo love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength\u2026\u201d, and Jesus adds, \u201cand the second greatest command is like the first one; \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.'\u201d [See Matt. 22:36-39]\n\n\nHe even adds: \u201cAll the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\u201d [v. 40]\nSo, if the Greatest Commandment is to love God and love others, then the greatest sin is failure to love as Jesus commands us.\nLove is our only law.\nNow, let\u2019s go out and live it.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming\xa0\u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 4th, 2018. \nHe is also the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

151,Debunking the Canonization Preservation Myth,"May 8, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nIn just a few days, I\u2019ll be co-hosting a conference in Seattle, WA with a few friends called \u201cJesus, the Bible and the Holy Spirit\u201d. This event will explore the differing perspectives on the Inerrancy and Infallibility of Scripture, as well as how often Christians substitute the Bible for Jesus, or the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nAs we discuss the Bible, one thing that always comes up is the myth of scriptural preservation. Basically, this is the view espoused by Biblicists that God made sure to preserve and protect the Scriptures throughout history so that we could have a Bible that contained His infallible and inerrant Word.\nWhat\u2019s usually claimed is that the early Christians curated the Biblical Canon [especially the Gospels and the epistles of Paul, Peter, James, and John], and later Church Councils [like the Councils of Nicea and Trent in the 4th Century] identified the true scriptures that were \u201cGod-breathed\u201d and eliminated the fakes and forgeries [often called \u201cpseudepigrapha\u201d because they were not actually written by the person whose name was attached to the document].\nIn this fantasy version of the Biblical Canon, there was complete agreement on which books were \u201cCanon\u201d and which were heretical or non-Canon. But that\u2019s not reality.\nAlmost every early Church Father had their own version of what they considered Canon. Granted, there were many [most] who accepted the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and most of the letters of Paul. But some did not recognize John\u2019s Revelation, or 1 and 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, or Jude, or even James, as belonging to the Christian scriptures.\n\n\nSome early Christians included books that most of us have never heard of, and that most Christians would outright reject like The Shepherd of Hermas, The Wisdom of Solomon, The Didache, The Apocalypse of Peter, The Epistle of Barnabus, First Clement, and Second Clement.\nFor the record, many New Testament scholars today readily admit that Paul most certainly did not write the \u201cPastoral Epistles\u201d attributed to him, [perhaps not even Ephesians or Colossians], nor did Peter write either 1 Peter or 2 Peter. This means that the Holy Scriptures we hold today contain pseudepigrapha, whether we like it or not.\nSo, as much as some Protestant Christians today want us to believe that God\u2019s hand was guiding the Canonization process and that the Holy Spirit was inspiring and leading these godly men to identify what was \u2013 and what wasn\u2019t \u2013 scripture to preserve the Word of God and oversee the assembly and printing of the Holy Bible is ludicrous.\nThe main question would be: Which of these processes did God lovingly and miraculously guide?\nWas God\xa0overseeing the selection of the 78 Eastern Orthodox books, or was He guiding the selection of the 66 Protestant books?\n\n\n\n\nWas God carefully speaking to those who selected the 81 books of the Ethiopian Church, or was God\u2019s Spirit whispering to the Catholic Church when they chose their 73 books?\nWas\xa0 God actually inspiring those dear and wise Brothers who chose the 68 books of the Syrian Orthodox Canon, but ignoring the prayers of the other Christians who assembled the other lists of \u201capproved\u201d books?\nOf course, it\u2019s easy for us to claim that God was obviously intimately involved in the selection of the Canon of Scripture that is common to our particular faith tradition. But to do so is to assume that our Canon \u2013 and only our Canon \u2013 was Divinely inspired.\nThe truth is this: The Canon of Scripture was written by men. It was preserved by men. It was translated by men. It was selected by men. It was published by men. It is \u2013 even today \u2013 taught and defended by men.\nSome of these men were divinely inspired by God. Others may not have been.\nOur job is to use our minds and engage our brains to determine what is, and what is not, of God.\nPersonally, I believe that Jesus is our yardstick. Jesus is our lens and filter and light. If we have seen Jesus, we have seen what the Father is really like. Everything, I believe, should be measured by Jesus.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the forthcoming \u201cJesus Unbound: How the Bible Keeps Us From Hearing the Word of God\u201d,\xa0available July 7th, 2018.

152,Was The Gospel Preached In All The World? Yes!,"May 8, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\u201cAnd\xa0this gospel of the kingdom will be preached\xa0in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\u201d \u2013 Jesus [Mathew 24:14]\nFor many, this entire chapter in Matthew is about the End of the World. But, is it?\n\nActually, no, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the destruction of Jerusalem which Jesus predicted would happen in that same generation:\n\n\n\u201cThis generation shall not pass, until all these things are fulfilled.\u201d [v.34]\nIf we start at the beginning of Chapter 24, we notice that the entire conversation starts as Jesus and his disciples exit the Temple. As the disciples marvel at how amazing the Temple is, Jesus warns them that \u201ca time is coming when not one stone will be left upon another.\u201d [v. 2] Upon hearing this, they ask Jesus \u201cWhen shall these things be?\u201d [v. 3]\nUnfortunately, the King James Version, and a few other Dispensational translations of the Bible, have the disciples ask about \u201cthe end of the world\u201d [v.3], but the actual phrase they used was:\n\u201cTell us,\xa0when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your\xa0coming and of\xa0the end of the age?\u201d [v.3]\nNote, please, that they are still asking, in context, about when and how the Temple is going to be destroyed and thrown down to the ground. This question about \u201cthe sign of your coming\u201d is still related to that act of judgment upon the city of Jerusalem which Jesus is about to elaborate upon. This is the same sort of \u201ccoming\u201d that John alludes to in Revelation when he reports that Jesus threatens to \u201ccome to\u201d one of the churches that are disobedient in order to \u201ctake away your\xa0lampstand, unless you repent.\u201d [Rev. 2:5]\n\n\nSo, the disciples understood all of this as fitting in perfectly with Apocalyptic language which is used all throughout the Hebrew scriptures to signify God\u2019s judgment against those who disobey His commands. This is why, when Jesus mentions the destruction of the Temple, they ask, \u201cwhat is the sign of your coming [to administer this judgment]?\u201d\nThe \u201cend of the age\u201d they ask about, [not the \u201cend of the world\u201d as the KJV tries hard to misdirect us], was the end of the Jewish age; something predicted by the prophet Daniel in Chapter 9:24-27.\nSo, what we\u2019re mainly concerned about here is when Jesus says that \u201cthis Gospel of the Kingdom will be preached in all the world\u2026and then the end will come.\u201d [Mt. 24:14]\nWhat trips many people up is that they assume that this hasn\u2019t happened yet.\nBut, what if the New Testament tells us that it has happened?\nPaul seems to believe that the Gospel of the Kingdom was preached in all the world. He says as much in 4 different places:\n\u201c\u2026the gospel,\xa0which has come to you, as indeed\xa0in the whole world it is\xa0bearing fruit and increasing\u2026\u201d [Col. 1:5-6]\n\n\n\u201c\u2026not shifting from\xa0the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed\xa0in all creation\xa0under heaven\u2026\u201d\xa0[Col. 1:23]\n\u201cBut\xa0they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says,\xa0\u201cLord, who has believed what he has heard from us?\u201d\xa0\xa0So\xa0faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.\xa0But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for \u2018Their voice has gone out\xa0to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.\u201d [Romans 10:16-18]\n\u201cNow to him who is able to strengthen you\xa0according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ,\xa0according to the revelation of the mystery\xa0that was kept secret for\xa0long ages\xa0but\xa0has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God,\xa0to bring about the obedience of faith\u2026\u201d\xa0[Romans 16:25-26]\n\n\n\n\nSo, according to Paul, the Gospel WAS preached \u201cin the whole world\u201d, \u201cin all creation\u201d, \u201cto all the earth\u201d, \u201cto the ends of the world\u201d and was \u201cmade known to all nations.\u201d\nTherefore, according to the prophecy given by Jesus, the \u201cend of the age\u201d can now come \u2013 and in AD 70 it most certainly did come.\nWhen Jerusalem was destroyed, those who rejected Christ and His message of enemy love reaped the fruits of living by the sword \u2013 they died by the sword. This destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple meant the end of the Jewish Age. To this very day \u2013 nearly 2,000 years later \u2013 the age remains at an end. There is no Temple to offer sacrifices, because Christ was the true Temple, and we are now the living Temple where God lives by His Spirit. There is no longer any daily sacrifice, because Jesus was the true Lamb of God who took away the sins of the world, and we are now the daily, living sacrifice to God. There is no longer any Jewish priesthood, because Jesus is our true High Priest, and we are now priests of God who function as representatives [ambassadors] of Christ and His Kingdom.\n\n\nThe Gospel of the Kingdom was preached \u201cin all the world\u201d prior to AD 70, and then the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed within that generation [just 40 years later], exactly as Jesus predicted.\nWe are now citizens of a new Kingdom. We are children of the New Jerusalem which is from above, not made with human hands. Christ reigns in us and through us.\nThe Temple of God is now made of living stones which is being built up to cover the entire earth.\nWhat Jesus prophesied has come to pass. We are now the living testimonies of His resurrection in the world today.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

153,The Surprise Wedding of the Lamb,"May 3, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nMany Christians today love to say that they stand for the Biblical idea of marriage. By that, they do not refer to the polygamy of Abraham, or David, or Solomon. They do not mean marrying two sisters as Jacob did. No, they usually mean the sort of \u201cBiblical\u201d marriage that Jesus talks about in Matthew 19.\nAs proof that Jesus saw marriage as being between one man and one woman, they point to one verse in the Matthew 19 where the Pharisees try to trap Jesus by asking him about divorce. In response to the question of whether or not it is \u201clawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason\u201d, Jesus gives an answer that reminds them of the fact that God\u2019s original intention was that the two would become one flesh. How could anyone separate them if they were both one flesh?\n\n\nThis is the entire point Jesus is trying to make.\nYet, somehow, Christians are convinced that Jesus was speaking out against gay marriage, or defining marriage as between a man and a woman only.\nBut, the question wasn\u2019t about gay marriage. The question was about whether a man \u2013 who is already married to a woman \u2013 is allowed to divorce her \u201cfor any and every reason.\u201d\nNote that, a few verses later, when Jesus suggests that a man should not divorce his wife for any reason except sexual immorality, the disciples respond by saying:\n\u201cIf this is the way it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s better not to marry at all!\u201d [v.10]\nImagine that. The disciples think that, if a man can\u2019t divorce a woman any time he feels like, for any reason at all, there\u2019s no point in being married.\nThis should give you an idea of what the First Century idea of marriage was. Or, at least, the male idea of marriage at that time. \nBut, notice that the Pharisees don\u2019t ask about whether it\u2019s lawful for a woman to divorce her husband. That\u2019s because a woman had no such right. She was property. The man had all the power.\nJesus is responding the way he does to their question because he is attempting to restore this unbalanced relationship. His answer is meant to give women peace of mind. He wants the husband to love his wife as he loves himself and to put himself in her position \u2013 to see things from her point of view; to consider her vulnerability above his own convenience and pleasure.\n\n\nA divorce for a woman at that time was essentially a death sentence. Usually, an older woman was cast aside by her husband so that he might take a younger wife. This meant that the older woman\u2019s chances of remarrying were quite slim. Begging or prostitution were her only options, in that case.\nJesus knows this and he is trying to change that.\nHowever: The passage is not about marriage. It\u2019s about divorce. But, Christians want this passage to be about marriage.\nYet, there IS another place in the Bible that gives us an idea of what Jesus thinks about marriage. It\u2019s actually surprising that Christians don\u2019t refer to these verses more often when it comes to marriage. Especially considering that it appears in the book of Revelation which many Christians can\u2019t seem to get enough of.\nIn Revelation, we read about Jesus\u2019s impending marriage to his precious Bride. In fact, all of creation \u2013 all of history itself \u2013 is leading us to this inevitable end time event: The Marriage Feast of the Lamb!\nNow, Jesus, as we know, is the Lamb of God. He is preparing for himself a Bride who is spotless. This Bride is the Church. (That\u2019s us). Jesus loves the Bride and has given up his life for his Bride.\n\n\n\n\nSo, all of the Bible points to this beautiful love story between God and His creation; and between Jesus and his Bride. And, one day soon, Jesus will appear in the sky. He will finally draw his Bride to himself. He will carry her away to the New Jerusalem to live forever and ever.\nAll of scripture is a beautiful love story between Jesus and His Bride.\nBut, if the Bride of Christ is the Church, then that means that the Bride of Christ is approximately 50% male.\nSo, one day, very soon, Jesus will marry billions of men [and women] in the largest marriage ceremony the universe has ever known.\nWhat does Jesus have to say about same-sex marriages? I think he affirms them. Especially since, one day, he will say \u201cI do\u201d to billions of other men who make up a very large portion of His beloved Bride.\nWhat do you think?\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

154,My Response To Robert Gagnon,"May 2, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nAfter I posted two articles here critiquing the traditional view of Homosexuality \u2013 Why Romans Doesn\u2019t Condemn Homosexuality and The Abomination of a Close Shave\xa0\xa0\u2013 someone brought them to the attention of well-known anti-gay Christian scholar, Robert A. Gagnon.\n\n\nJust in case you\u2019re not aware, Gagnon is often quoted in anti-gay documentaries or asked to appear on radio and television interviews to provide scriptural evidence that God hates homosexuality and that being gay is a choice to live in disobedience to God and His Holy Word. He\u2019s something of an expert. [Just ask him].\nGagnon, after reading my articles, wrote a carefully worded response which I will share in full, and respond to his comments below.\nHere\u2019s Gagnon\u2019s rebuttal:\n\u201cA fellow by the name of Keith Giles has posted online an article entitled \u201cWhy Romans Doesn\u2019t Condemn Homosexuality.\u201d Normally I wouldn\u2019t respond to such things because Keith Giles, to my knowledge, has no standing in the guild of biblical scholars. However, since many people have forwarded me his article, I\u2019m making an exception. All that I know of Keith Giles comes from his byline: \u201cKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u2018Jesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u2019. He is also the co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, the last-mentioned activity is appropriately named because in pushing the acceptance of homosexual unions, when Jesus viewed a male-female prerequisite for marriage (and thus all sexual relations) as foundational for sexual ethics, from which Jesus derived a limitation of two persons to a sexual union, Keith Giles adopts a heretical position.\n\u201cNow as to his argument\u2026.Giles contends that Paul is limiting his indictment of homosexual behavior in Rom 1:24-27 to actions conducted in the context of pagan ritual worship. My friends, this is dumb. Now in my first book, The Bible and Homosexual Practice (Abingdon), first published 17 years ago, I have four-and-a-half full pages in a section entitled, \u201cDid Paul Think Only Idol Worshipers Could Engage in Same-Sex Intercourse\u201d (pp. 284-89) devoted to showing why this is a bad argument. Does Giles even bother to read that or any other substantive rebuttal before he comes out in support of a view that represents a radical departure from the historic Christian witness? Is it too much to ask him to read 4\xbd pages and attempt to respond to the arguments therein?\n\u201cFor example, did it ever occur to him that none of the other vices that Paul goes on to mention in vv. 28-31 (like arrogance, greed, murder) are wrong only in the context of idolatrous associations? Paul\u2019s point is not that these vices occur only in idolatrous contexts but rather that in ignoring the evidence of \u201cthe things God made\u201d to worship statues in the image of humans or (worse still) animals, humans are more likely to ignore the evidence of male-female complementarity in human sexual structures.\n\n\n\u201cOr did it ever occur to Giles that the general term for sexual \u201cimpurity\u201d or \u201cuncleanness\u201d (akatharsia) in Rom 1:24 includes not only homosexual practice but also adultery, incest, bestiality, and fornication? Are these behaviors also wrong only in the context of idolatrous associations? Or that Paul\u2019s mention again of \u201cimpurity\u201d or \u201cuncleanness\u201d in 6:19 to characterize a past pattern of behavior to which Christians must not return does not presuppose conduct only in the context of idolatrous worship?\n\u201cOr did it ever occur to Giles that, had Paul wished to single out sex in the context of idolatrous cults, there was no reason to limit his indictment to same-sex relations? Or that nothing in the description of Rom 1:26-27 presupposes idolatrous associations but only the fact of females having sex with females and males having sex with males?\n\u201cOr did it not occur to Giles that Paul\u2019s indictment of lesbianism doesn\u2019t fit the claim since we know of no cultic acts involving lesbian sex?\n\u201cOr did Giles stop to think that the reference to \u201cmen who lie with a male\u201d (arsenokoitai), a distinctly Jewish term formulated from the absolute Levitical prohibitions of man-male intercourse (18:22; 20:13), in the offender list in 1 Cor 6:9-10 (so too 1 Tim 1:9-10) is an offender group distinct from idolaters?\n\n\n\u201cOr did Giles not ponder that no Jew in the ancient world (including two prominent first-century Jews, Philo of Alexandria and Josephus) limited their indictment of homosexual practice to same-sex relations in idolatrous contexts?\n\u201cIs Giles even aware that there is a clear intertextual echo between Rom 1:23-27 and Genesis 1:26-27 that establishes that Paul rejects all homosexual practice because of what it is not: a relationship that conforms to God\u2019s design of a complementary sexual pair, \u201cmale and female [God] made them\u201d?\n\u201cEven William Loader, a NT scholar who is thoroughly supportive of homosexual relationships and who has written more on sexual ethics in early Judaism and Christianity than anyone in modern times acknowledges that \u201cIt is inconceivable that [Paul] would approve of any same-sex acts\u201d and that Rom 1:26-27 \u201cincluded, but [was] by no means limited to exploitative pederasty,\u201d \u201csexual abuse of male slaves,\u201d or \u201csame-sex acts \u2026 performed within idolatrous ritual contexts\u201d (The New Testament on Sexuality [Eerdmans, 2012], 322, 325).\n\u201cSimilarly, Bernadette Brooten, a self-identified lesbian and a NT scholar who wrote a major work on lesbianism in antiquity, has stated: \u201cI see Paul as condemning all forms of homoeroticism as the unnatural acts of people who had turned away from God\u201d (Love Between Women: Early Christian Responses to Female Homoeroticism [University of Chicago Press, 1996], 244).\n\n\n\u201cSo too \u201cgay\u201d historian Louis Crompton, though expressing sympathy for the claim that \u201cPaul\u2019s words were not directed at \u2018bona fide\u2019 homosexuals in committed relationships,\u201d soberly acknowledges that \u201csuch a reading, however well-intentioned, seems strained and unhistorical. Nowhere does Paul or any other Jewish writer of this period imply the least acceptance of same-sex relations under any circumstance. The idea that homosexuals might be redeemed by mutual devotion would have been wholly foreign to Paul or any other Jew or early Christian\u201d (Homosexuality and Civilization [Harvard University Press, 2003], 114).\n\n\n\u201cIn short, is it too much to ask Keith Giles to read and grapple with the strongest arguments against the position that he wants to reach to satisfy his own prior ideology?\u201d\n**\nMY RESPONSE:\nNote: Since I\u2019m not friends with Robert Gagnon, I cannot comment directly to his Facebook page. This is why I\u2019m sharing my response here.\nHonestly, I\u2019m kinda humbled that someone of Gagnon\u2019s stature would even sneeze in my direction. After all, as he so rightly\xa0brings to everyone attention, I don\u2019t have my membership card to the Guild of Biblical Scholars. [Maybe my application got lost in the pile?]\n\n\nStill, he does nail me on my greatest sin \u2013 the failure to read everything that Mister Gagnon has ever written on this daunting subject before daring to attempt to handle such befuddling Biblical texts with only my own meager wits to guide me through the darkness.\nHe\u2019s right: I did NOT read all his writings in advance of writing my article.\nMy bad.\nStill, it would have been nice of him to at least attack my arguments more than he attacked me as a lowly, unscholarly peon. But I guess I\u2019m just an easy target. That low-hanging fruit will get you every time. [Just ask Eve].\nAnyway, what Gagnon fails to consider is that I might have actually read lots of other great scholarly material [other than his own] and even used some of it in the past to argue exactly what he is arguing for today \u2013 that homosexuality is a low-down, dirty sin.\nHe also fails to consider that I may have gone on to read even more New Testament scholars who [gasp] may disagree with him on these verses and that I may also have even prayed about this for several months, consulted a half-dozen of my friends who are both gay, and/or trained scholars and respected Bible teachers to get their take on these verses, and even to have them vet my own perspective on these verses.\n\n\nWhat I think Gagnon fails to realize mostly is his own agenda and bias in this area. He has developed a very large persona in the realm of anti-gay Christian Scholarship. He\u2019s been quoted and interviewed and appeared on documentaries as an anti-gay pastoral expert on the topic and written oh-so-many books and articles and blogs and post-it-notes and perhaps even a song or two about how God hates gayness and homosexuality is super-bad for you.\nAs I read through his lengthy, condescending \u201crebuttal\u201d of my articles, what I do not fail to consider is how Gagnon starts out from an assumption \u2013 that all gay people are sinners who need to repent or face the judgment and hellfire for all eternity. Because of that bias, he can\u2019t help but read those scriptures any other way. So, in some ways, I don\u2019t blame him for being so self-assured of his view. For him, it\u2019s an open-and-shut case.\nBut, I no longer come at this from the same angle that he does. I used to, but not anymore.\nFor me, there are several factors in play when it comes to verses of this sort in the New Testament: First, that there is a cultural bias on the author\u2019s end that isn\u2019t necessarily relevant to us today. Second, that there are linguistic and translation biases in our English Bibles that prevent us from seeing other possibilities. Finally, that there are hundreds of years [as Gagnon even mentions in his rebuttal] of tradition which reinforces those cultural biases and translation errors [or \u201cchoices\u201d] made many years ago.\n\n\nGagnon doesn\u2019t accept any of that. To him, all of that massive amount of tradition and unwavering narrowmindedness [for lack of a better term], is evidence itself that he is right and I am so very, very wrong.\nThis is exactly the same sort of reasoning [and translation bias] that helps to keep women out of the pulpit and \u201csilent\u201d in the Churches and forbidden from teaching a man.\nIt was also the same sort of approach that once kept black slaves in chains prior to the Civil War and allowed Christians to argue in favor of the practice using the Holy Bible.\nI\u2019d argue that this sort of approach isn\u2019t very helpful, or Christlike. But, who am I? I don\u2019t even have my Guild of Biblical Scholarship t-shirt.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

155,Did Peter Kill Ananias and Sapphira?,"April 26, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nYou may have heard the excellent podcast conversation between Brad Jersak, Michael Hardin and a few others, about this question of \u201cWho Killed Ananaias and Sapphira\u201d a few years ago. It\u2019s really fascinating stuff.\n\n\nEssentially, after a meandering discussion, they arrive at the idea that the death of these two people was an analog to the fall of Adam and Eve in the beginning of Genesis:\n-There is the creation of a beautiful new reality [compare the idyllic reality of Eden to the beautiful Acts 2 community].\n-Then there is the temptation [Adam and Eve with the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, and Ananias and Sapphira holding back of the money from the land that they sold].\n-Followed by the judgment [\u201cYou shall surely die\u201d, compared to the sudden death of both Ananias and Sapphira].\nAs fascinating as that may be [and I do find it pretty interesting], there is another theory that I had never heard before now, which is that Peter just straight up killed both of them.\nThis idea came up between a conversation I had over lunch this week with my publisher, Rafael Polendo. [I\u2019ll be honest and admit that he said the idea was based on a comment his wife made as they were both listening to that aforementioned podcast].\n\n\nAfter he brought up this idea, we started to explore the concept more in-depth and the more we talked it started to seem more and more likely that this may indeed be what happened.\nLet\u2019s look at a few facts of the case:\n\xa0\n*Both Ananias and Sapphira are buried instantaneously: According to historians, it was common practice to bury dead bodies soon after death, but not immediately afterwards. Typically, the body was first prepared for burial [and this was an involved, time-consuming process where the body was stripped, bathed, anointed with oils and certain burial spices, and then the limbs were bound and wrapped in cloths before burial.] There is also a precedent for the burial procession to start at the home of the deceased, surrounded by family members, and then leading out of the city to the burial site or tomb. So I have to ask, why wasn\u2019t Ananias\u2019s body held until his wife could be there to help prepare his body for burial? This would have been the most normal reaction to someone who had died. However, they do not inform the wife. They do not wait for her to help prepare his body for burial. Why? Perhaps because they were already anticipating that she would be killed next.\n\n\n*Why are men allowed to bury Sapphira? According to those same First Century Jewish customs, only another woman could prepare a woman\u2019s body for burial. But in the details provided to us in Acts, there were only men who carried out both bodies to the tomb for burial. Why is that? Why did they just skip those important steps about preparing the body for burial? Did they rush the process because they didn\u2019t want anyone to investigate the details of their deaths?\n*Is it likely that the Holy Spirit killed two people on the eve of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the Church?\xa0Jesus made a big deal about how He came to give us abundant life and that Satan is the one who comes to \u201csteal, kill and destroy.\u201d If the argument is that God could not allow such sin to spread throughout the Body of Christ, then please explain why God isn\u2019t killing pedophile priests or greedy televangelists who swindle the elderly out of their social security checks. I personally don\u2019t believe that it is consistent with the character of God [as revealed to us by Jesus] to do such a thing. However\u2026\n\n\n*Peter never seems to have really embraced the idea of nonviolence: He not only used his sword to cut off the soldier\u2019s ear in Gethsemane, he also never teaches on the idea of loving our enemies, turning the other cheek, or blessing those who curse us. Jesus does, of course. Paul does. Even John does. But in Acts and in 1 and 2 Peter, we have no examples of Peter ever embracing this central teaching of Jesus. Perhaps Peter was still holding on to \u201can eye for an eye\u201d as his rule, and not \u201clove your enemy.\u201d (Yes, I know that this is an argument from silence, but it is more consistent with Peter\u2019s character, than with God\u2019s character, to strike someone dead for lying.)\n*What happened to the rest of the money? This is also curious. Peter knows that there was a larger amount of money that their land sold for. As they both \u201cfall at his feet\u201d dead, is this not symbolic of later verses about offerings that are \u201claid at the apostle\u2019s feet\u201d to be distributed among the poor? If the balance of the money was held on either Ananias or Sapphira\u2019s body, there\u2019s a good chance that money was counted as an offering that rightfully belonged to God, and therefore to the Church.\n\n\n*Why does it say that \u201cgreat fear filled the Church\u201d after this? Is this not an example of the Fall of the Church as alluded to in the podcast discussion? The early Christians went from being filled with spontaneous love and compassion for one another \u2013 selling property and sharing all that they had so that \u201cthere was no needy person among them\u201d \u2013 and suddenly there is great fear. Remember, \u201cPerfect love casts out all fear\u201d [1 John 4:18], but the opposite is also true: \u201cFear casts out perfect love\u201d and this is what we see in the early Church. Once this great fear fills the Body of Christ, this spontaneous outpouring and flow of genuine love appears to be squelched. [Note: Yes, the early church did continue to show incredible compassion and charity for the poor for hundreds of years after this. But it\u2019s notable that no other Christian community except the one in Acts 2 appears to have practiced such a radical outpouring of unbridled love and affection. Perhaps this event, which caused such great fear, cut this enthusiasm short].\n\n\n*Why does John Chrysostom [an early Christian teacher] strongly suggest that Peter did actually kill them?\n\n\n\u201cAnd Peter too wrought a twofold slaughter, nevertheless what he did was of the Spirit.\u201d (Saint John Chrysostom,\xa0Homilies on Matthew)\nHere, Chrysostrom admits that A) Peter \u201cwrought a twofold slaughter\u201d and B) \u201cwhat he did was of the Spirit.\u201d\nThis strongly suggests that it was Peter \u2013 not the Spirit of God \u2013 who slaughtered them and that \u201cwhat he did\u201d was essentially \u201cblessed\u201d by the Holy Spirit.\nLater, Chrysostrom also says:\n\u201cPeter all but pleads for himself, when at the point to inflict the punishment, and at the same time gives a lesson to the rest. For because the act would seem exceeding stern, therefore it is that he does so much in the case.\u201d (Saint John Chrysostom,\xa0Homilies on Acts)\nIn this quote, Chrysostrom argues that Peter sought to justify his own actions as he himself is \u201cat the point to inflict the punishment\u201d.\n[Note: While Chrysostrom lived in 400AD, long after the events recorded in Acts 5, it is possible that his opinion of this event was based on early Christian tradition passed down from previous church leaders].",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/04/did-peter-kill-ananias-and-sapphira/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
156,The Abomination of a Close Shave?,"April 24, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nIn the New Testament scriptures, the Apostle Paul speaks out against a trend that he sees as being \u201cunnatural\u201d and an \u201cabomination\u201d and warns that Christians need to be on their guard against this dangerous practice.\nWhat is it?\n[It\u2019s not what you think].\n\n\n\nSee, in Paul\u2019s day being a man meant keeping your hair short and your beard long. Why? Because women had long hair and smooth faces. So, to Paul \u2013 and many others in his day \u2013 if a man had long hair and shaved his beard off, he was accused of \u201cgoing against nature.\u201d\nThe Greek word Paul uses to describe this trend is \u201cmalakoi\u201d and the best translation of the word into English is \u201ceffeminate\u201d.\nIn the first century, \u201cmalakoi\u201d was most often used to reference men who shaved daily and had no beards. These men were often ridiculed and accused of wanting to look like women with clean-shaven faces.\nThis term was used as an epithet against men who are not masculine enough, as in, \u201cYou punch like a girl.\u201d\nPlato, for example, in his \u201cRepublic\u201d, wrote famously that \u201ctoo much music made a man soft [malakoi], and feeble; unfit for battle.\u201d\nAristotle also warned about the dangers of men becoming too soft [malakoi] by over-indulging in pleasures rather than balancing out their lives with acts of physical and mental discipline.\n\n\nEven Josephus, the first century Jewish historian [and contemporary of Jesus and Paul] used the term \u201cmalakos\u201d to describe men who were weak and soft through lack of courage in battle.\nSo, the word \u201cmalakoi\u201d refers to being \u201csoft\u201d, rather than masculine, and it occurs four times, in three verses in the New Testament. [Jesus uses the word to refer to soft clothing, for example, in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25].\nNow, here\u2019s the problem: \u201cMalakoi\u201d is translated in most English Bibles today as \u201chomosexual\u201d.\nSeriously.\nDo you think that a man who shaves his beard and has long hair and enjoys music is a homosexual?\nHopefully not.\nPaul and others in the first century didn\u2019t either. How do we know that? Because the word is never used to refer to someone who is homosexual. It is always used to describe a\xa0heterosexual\xa0male whose behavior is more feminine, or \u201csoft.\u201d\nThis is what Paul had in mind in 1 Cor. 6:9. In fact, if you go to the actual Greek language, this verse does not refer to homosexuals, even though most English Bibles use the phrase \u201cmen who have sex men\u201d rather than \u201ceffeminate.\u201d\n\n\nIn the Greek the text actually reads:\n\u201cKnow ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind..\u201d \u2013 1 Cor. 6:9\nBut the definition of \u201ceffeminate\u201d is not the same today as it was in the first century, is it?\nBack then it was \u201cunnatural\u201d for a man to shave his face and grow a mullet. Today, mullets still aren\u2019t so popular, but we wouldn\u2019t say that a person who sported one was \u201cunrighteous\u201d and unwelcome in the Kingdom of God. [Again, I would hope not].\nThe term \u201ceffeminate\u201d is based on a cultural bias, not an absolute rule.\nIf you want to make it an absolute statement, then we must adopt Paul\u2019s first century ideals about what makes a man \u201ceffeminate\u201d and that means that all men are forbidden to shave their beards or wear their hair below their ears to be considered godly. It also means that women can\u2019t wear pants, or cut their hair short [and who wants to be in charge of defining \u201cshort\u201d for the rest of the Christian world?], etc.\n\n\nSo, do we all want to adopt Paul\u2019s ideas about cultural norms? Are we willing to live by this rule?\n\u201cDoth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.\u201d [1 Cor. 11:14-15]\n\n\nWe have to decide if we honestly believe that a man with a clean-shaven face is an abomination or not. We have to decide if guys with long hair aren\u2019t welcome in the Kingdom of God, or if perhaps in this case, the Apostle Paul might have only been speaking to the Christians in first century Corinth about what it meant in their day to conform to cultural norms.\nWhat do you think?\nPlease leave a comment below and let me know your thoughts.\nIf this article blessed or challenged you, please consider sharing it on social media.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

157,Why Romans Doesn\u2019t Condemn Homosexuality,"April 23, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nWhat is Paul really talking about in the first chapter of Romans?\nLet\u2019s start with Romans 1:18 to try to understand what Paul is really talking about here. I think it helps to actually start \u201cfrom the top\u201d, as it were.\n\nIn verse 18, Paul starts to talk about a group of people and this is how he identifies them:\n\n\n\u201cThe wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness..\u201d\nWho is he talking about here? He\u2019s talking about \u201cgodless\u201d and \u201cwicked\u201d people, in general.\nIn v. 21 he says those same people\u2019s thinking,\xa0\u201cbecame futile and their foolish hearts were darkened\u201d.\nThen he says in v. 22 that those same people\xa0\u201cclaimed to be wise but became fools\u201d.\nAnd in v. 23 he says that they:\xa0\u201cexchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.\u201d\nThat is idol worship.\nIn summary, these wicked and godless people denied the knowledge of God and began to worship idols.\nBecause of this:\n\u201cTherefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.\u201d [v.24]\nSo, because they denied God and worshipped idols God\u2019s response was to give them over to \u201cshameful desires of their hearts\u2026for the degrading of their bodies with one another.\u201d\n\n\nPlease Note: Sexual intercourse in pagan temples was quite common in the worship of idols. This is what Paul is referring to here, and he continues to describe this in verse 25:\n\u201cThey exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator\u2014who is forever praised.\u201d\nThis is all about idol worship and it involved sexual intercourse. What Paul is condemning here is the use of sexual intercourse as part of the worship of created things, or idols.\nLust is lust. Ritual pagan sex qualifies as \u201cdegrading their bodies with one another\u201d \u2013 whether gay or straight.\nNow, Paul continues his progressive thought by saying, in verse 26:\n\u201cBecause of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.\u201d\nOk, wait\u2026because of what? Because these people \u2013 who were engaged in worshipping pagan idols \u2013 started degrading their bodies with one another in ritual sexual intercourse: \u201cGod gave them over to shameful lusts.\u201d\nSo far, this would be bad no matter if the sex were gay or straight.\nThere\u2019s a lot more to point out, but let me pause here a just a moment to say this:\n\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone who is gay due to the effects of worshipping idols through sexual intercourse.\nDo you?\nMaybe those people exist, but I would venture to say that the majority of people who identify as being gay today did not end up that way because they used to engage in pagan sexual practices in the temples of Zeus or Artemis.\nI don\u2019t even know any gay people who feel attracted to people of the same sex due to denying that God exists. In fact, just the opposite, I know many people who identify as gay who profess saving faith in Christ and who even demonstrate the heart and character of Christ. They do not engage in \u201cshameful desires of their hearts\u201d any more than my straight Christian friends do. They also do not \u201cworship and serve created things rather than the Creator\u201d.\nHaving said that, let\u2019s go back to Paul and continue the study.\nAfter this Paul says,\n\u201cEven their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.\u201d\n\n\nPlease try to follow the flow of Paul\u2019s statements here:\nThere were people who denied God. They started to worship idols. That worship involved sexual intercourse. That intercourse aroused unnatural lusts. The end result was a judgment within their bodies for denying God and engaging in pagan ritual sex rites.\nKeep in mind: anyone who is \u201cinflamed with lust\u201d is in sin \u2013 whether gay or straight. But Paul\u2019s entire flow of thought begins with a discussion about those who deny God, worship created things rather than the creator, engage in ritual sexual intercourse as part of that worship, and then\u2026BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS, God has judged them and given them over to their lusts.\nLet me ask you: What if Paul\u2019s descriptions here went like this:\n\n\n*People denied God\n*Those people worshipped idols\n*They worshipped idols by engaging in male/female sex acts\nWould you conclude that God hated male/female intercourse?\nWhy not? Isn\u2019t that what people do when he goes on to describe their acts of homosexual intercourse?\nIf we don\u2019t read Romans 1 as a de facto condemnation of straight sex [and the majority of the chapter is about straight sex], then why do we read it as a condemnation of gay sex acts?\n\n\nCould it be because we have a bias against gay sex that we don\u2019t have against straight sex?\nIf we lay aside our inherent bias against gay sex, we can see that Paul\u2019s entire point is that the denial of God and the worship of idols through sexual intercourse [gay or straight] is what is \u201cshameful\u201d and not the type of sexual intercourse itself.\nSexual intercourse in the worship of idols is evil. This is Paul\u2019s entire point.\nStraight sex is not evil. What matters is the context. Is it between two people who love one another and who also love and trust in God? Then it isn\u2019t what Paul is speaking of here in Romans 1.\nMy point is simply this: Romans 1 doesn\u2019t try to provide any commentary on whether or not gay sexual intercourse is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d.\nPaul\u2019s purpose in Romans 1 isn\u2019t to explain why homo/hetero sex itself is wrong/right. His point would be exactly the same if he were describing straight sexual intercourse used in pagan ritual worship.\nDoes that make sense?\nThat same judgment they received would come equally to those who engaged in gay or straight sexual intercourse if it was for the purpose of pagan idol worship.\n\n\nBelieve it or not, there really are Christians who ARE gay, and they DO worship God and they DO love Jesus and they do NOT engage in fornication and they are NOT consumed by their lusts.\nSo, this passage does not apply to them.\nIn conclusion, I wish that I could introduce you to the gay and transgender Christians I know. If I could, you might find that these are not \u201cperverts\u201d or \u201cabominations\u201d. Instead, you might see what I have seen, which is an exceptional grace for people who shun them and marginalize them.\nThey are quick to even forgive family members who shame them. They are obedient to Jesus to pray for those Christians who slander them and call them names [like \u201cpervert\u201d for example] with tears in their eyes and pain in their heart.\nI\u2019ve seen Jesus in the lives of my gay and transgender brothers and sisters over the last few years in deeper and more profound ways than I believe I have ever seen in many of my straight Christian friends.\nI hope to learn from them how to love and forgive and walk in grace and mercy towards everyone, even those brothers and sisters who cannot accept them for who they really are.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

158,The Ordination of Bread and Wine,"April 20, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nIn Exodus 29:33, God gives instructions to the priests regarding how the sacrifices are to be performed, and by whom. In this section, God wraps it up by saying:\n\u201cThey [the Priests] are to eat these offerings by which atonement was made for their ordination and consecration.\xa0But no one else may eat them, because they are sacred.\u201d\n\n\nVery simply, only the Old Covenant priests were allowed to perform the sacrifices. These offerings were specifically for atonement and they also were made for the ordination and consecration of the priests themselves. Only the priests were allowed to eat the meat that was offered there on the altar because that meat was \u201csacred\u201d.\nGot it? Good. Now, let\u2019s skip over to Hebrews chapter 9 where we read about how the old covenant [the \u201cfirst covenant\u201d] was set up with rules and regulations about the tabernacle [and later the temple] and how all of those things were \u201ccopies\u201d or symbolic of the \u201crealities\u201d which were found in Christ.\n\u201cIt was necessary, then, for\xa0the copies\xa0of the heavenly things\xa0to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.\u201d\xa0[Hebrews 9:23]\n\u201cThe\xa0law is only a shadow\xa0of the good things\xa0that are coming\u2014not the realities\xa0themselves.\u201d[Hebrews 10:1]\nNow, I\u2019d like you to notice something that the writer of Hebrews points out in Hebrews 13:10:\n\n\n\u201cWe have an altar from\xa0which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.\u201d\nWow. Do you get it?\nUnder the Old Covenant, the priests of that old covenant were the only one\u2019s allowed to eat what was offered on that altar. No one else had the right to eat from it.\nBut now, under the New Covenant,\xa0\u201cwe have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle [those priests of the old covenant] have no right to eat.\u201d\nWhat is \u201cour altar\u201d? What is it that we have a right to eat that they, and others, do not?\nIt\u2019s Christ!\nJesus is our true High Priest. He is our true sacrifice for sins and upon the cross he offered up his own life in the temple of his body as an atonement for us.\nJust like in the Old Covenant, only a certain group of people had the right to eat of the meat that was sacrificed for atonement. Who were they? The priests of that old covenant.\nNow, under the New Covenant, another sacrifice for atonement is made, and only a certain group of people have the right to eat of that meat that was offered. Who are they? Us! And what does that make us? It makes us priests in the Kingdom of God.\n\n\nJesus gave us His body to eat. He said that only those who eat his flesh and drink his blood have any life in them. At the last supper, Jesus said, \u201cThis is my body which is broken for you. Take and eat.\u201d And then he took the cup and said, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant in my blood.\u201d\n\nPaul says it this way:\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?\u201d\xa0[1 Cor. 9:13]\nSo, if we are \u201cin Christ\u201d then we are the only ones who have permission to eat of the flesh that was offered for atonement, and when we eat of that flesh, and partake of that sacrifice, we are also accepting our \u201cordination and consecration\u201d as priests under the New Covenant of God.\n\u201cAs you come to him, the living Stone\u2026you also, like living stones, are being built\xa0into a spiritual house to be a\xa0holy priesthood,\xa0offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\u201d [1 Peter 2:4-5]\n\n\n\u201cBut you are a chosen people,\xa0a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.\u201d [1 Peter 2:9-10]\n\n\nHalleluiah!\nWhat\u2019s more, when the priests of the old covenant ate from the altar it was:\n\u201c\u2026 for their ordination and consecration\u201d [Ex. 29:33]\nLikewise, we also eat of the bread and drink the cup of Christ in order to affirm our own ordination and consecration into the Priesthood of Believers.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d never seen this before and now that I\u2019ve connected those dots, it unlocks many other realizations about our identity in Christ.\nCan\u2019t wait to hear what you think!

159,What If God Is Not In Control?,"April 19, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nQuite often, we comfort ourselves during difficult seasons of our life, with the assurance that God is in control. What we mean by that is, although we are powerless to change our situation, God is somehow at work behind the scenes to make sure everything works out ok in the end. So, we may have lost our job, or discovered someone we love has cancer, or miscarried our third child, or declared bankruptcy, or something else disturbing, and it\u2019s all ok because, we tell ourselves, \u201cGod is in control.\u201d\n\n\nBut, what if we\u2019re wrong? What if God is NOT in control at all? What if bad things happen and God isn\u2019t orchestrating anything at all behind the scenes?\n\nFirst of all, I feel the need to point out that it\u2019s entirely possible for God not to be in control and yet, at the same time, for God to be working behind the scenes to make everything work out better for us in the end. In other words, God\u2019s ability to bring a blessing out of our chaos isn\u2019t dependent upon God being in complete control of the universe. It\u2019s very possible that God\u2019s power is more about an ability to influence events and people in more subtle ways without the need for God to necessarily control events or people. Does that make sense?\nAuthors like Thomas Jay Ord and Mark Karris, for example, suggest that God\u2019s nature is uncontrolling love. If this is so, they argue, then God is not in control of the universe, but God is very much involved in our daily affairs, all the same. So, God does not \u2013 and even cannot \u2013 make anyone do anything against their will, simply because to do so would be to cease being God. In other words, God\u2019s nature is expressed in an uncontrolling\xa0love for everyone. So, God, by definition, is not able to coerce anyone to do anything, nor would God ever even want to do such a thing. Instead, God does everything possible,\xa0within the boundaries of this uncontrolling\xa0love nature, to show us a better way, without imposing anything upon us.\n\n\nThis means that we are responsible \u2013 fully and completely \u2013 for our own actions. God makes suggestions. God shows us a higher love. God stands with us. God walks beside us through the valley of the shadow of death. God remains alongside us whether we choose wisely, or foolishly. God never wavers as our constant source of strength. But, in all of this, the one God is not doing is controlling anyone, or anything, in any way. Because that\u2019s not who God is.\nI\u2019ll confess, this is a hard one for me to accept. Mainly because, in my own personal life, I have experienced several unexplainable miracles. Many of those miracles really seem to be examples of God stepping in and forcibly controlling the outcomes of otherwise horrific or tragic events.\nFor example, God stopped me in my tracks one evening as I was walking down a road. It felt as if a giant hand was pushing against my chest. I was half-way between the prison honor camp, where my band was about to play a concert that evening, and the La Tuna Federal Prison fence, (which was surrounded by guard towers). I had decided to walk down to the fork in the road to meet my fellow band-mates who were running late. I figured they might miss the turn, as the drummer and I had done, and I wanted to make sure they found us.\n\n\nBut, then I felt that hand on my chest, so I stood frozen in place for about ten minutes and wondered what was going on. All I knew was that I should not move, but I did not know why. Not until the prison chaplain turned the corner on the two-lane road coming out of the prison and pulled up right next to me and asked, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d did I learn that there had been a bed-check which revealed a missing prisoner. That sent the prison into lock-down.\n\u201cDo you see that guard up there?\u201d he asked, thumbing back over his shoulder towards the large gray tower about 50 yards away. \u201cThere\u2019s a sniper with your head in his sights right now asking for permission to open fire because they suspect you\u2019re the missing prisoner heading for the main road.\u201d\nSo, that\u2019s why God stopped me in my tracks.\nAnother example of when God apparently stepped in and controlled things was when my Dad fell off the roof of our mobile home and landed on his head, shattering and pulverizing three vertebrae in his neck. The doctor\u2019s looked at the x-rays and told him he would have a 50/50 chance of being paralyzed for life \u2013 but only if the greatest spinal surgeon in the world did the surgery. Of course, that surgeon was in Moscow, so his odds dropped significantly from there.\n\n\nA few days later, my Dad went through a CAT scan machine, just minutes after our Southern Baptist Pastor and one of his deacons, had prayed for him. When the results of the scan came back, the doctor told my father he was sorry. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m holding your x-rays in my left hand showing the damage to your three vertebrae, and in my right hand I\u2019m holding your CAT scan which shows you have no damage whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\nMy Dad laughed and said, \u201cI know what happened. Jesus healed me!\u201d\nSo, in those two examples, it\u2019s hard for me to understand how God did not control things to change what was about to happen. If God hadn\u2019t stopped me in my tracks, I\u2019d probably have been shot dead that day. If God did not heal my Dad, he\u2019d be paralyzed from the neck down.\nI have other personal testimonies like these. Stories of God\u2019s divine intervention and miraculous healing where I can only say that God was, most certainly, in control.\nSo, what do I do with this? Is God in control? If so, in what way? Is God\u2019s nature uncontrolling love? Then, if so, how and why did these healings take place? What stopped me in my tracks on the road that afternoon?\n\n\nFor some people, the idea that God doesn\u2019t control anything is easier to believe than miracle stories like these. But for me, the idea of God\u2019s uncontrolling love makes sense theoretically \u2013 I actually embrace the idea \u2013 even though my problem is reconciling this concept with the miracles I\u2019ve experienced.\nThis leaves me with several uncomfortable options: Either God is in control of everything, but only chooses to intervene occasionally, or God is not in control of anything and miracles are unexplained and random accidents of nature, like glitches in the matrix or hiccups of physics. Or, maybe as a third option, God is not in control of people, but God is in control of nature and this control is limited by factors we don\u2019t completely understand.\nI don\u2019t know. Honestly, I\u2019m really not sure what to think.\nIt\u2019s very hard to understand why my friends Richard and Mary-Anne weren\u2019t healed of their cancer, but my Dad was healed of his crushed vertebrae. It\u2019s hard to reconcile why one friend\u2019s daughter came back to life after being dead on the operating table, but another friend\u2019s father died suddenly.\n\n\nThese questions have no easy answers. Some people believe they\u2019ve got it all figured out. They reduce everything to an oversimplified definition of faith and contend that there is some mystical formula that everyone can take advantage of if they only believe in the right way or pray the magic words in the right tone of voice. But I don\u2019t believe any of that.\nTo me, there are no formulas. Things happen: good and bad. We can\u2019t explain it. We can\u2019t control it. We can only thank God that we don\u2019t have to go through any of it alone. He is with us. He promises never to leave us, nor forsake us. Whether the storm passes or we pass through the storm, Jesus is there in the boat with us.\nThat\u2019s enough for me.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

160,What Makes Our Experiences Real?,"April 18, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nA friend asked me a question the other day about whether or not our spiritual experiences should be considered \u201creal\u201d if we know that those experiences were induced by low blow sugar or sleep paralysis, for example.\nIt\u2019s a great question. In fact, as I was watching the Netflix mini-series \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d, I had a very similar conversation with my wife about the spiritual experiences induced by the meditative techniques of the Rajneesh\xa0cult.\n\n\n\nThe cult leader, Bhagwan, had new disciples to his cult undergo an initiation\xa0of sorts in which they had to spend 3 minutes breathing in and out as rapidly as possible [to induce hyperventilation and starve oxygen to their brains], then they would jump up and down for 3 minutes and shout \u201cWoo!\u201d every time their feet hit the ground [to induce euphoria], and then they would spend 3 minutes acting out every random impulse that came to their minds, like screaming, shouting, dancing, rolling on the floor, etc. [to overstimulate their brain activity], and then finally he had them stop and sit silently for 3 minutes [to allow their brains to process all of these experiences]. Invariably, everyone who underwent this process ended up crying, hearing God\u2019s voice, seeing a vision, or simply felt overcome with an overwhelming sense of peace that they had never felt before.\nOnce people had this profound spiritual experience, they became convinced that their spiritual guru had great powers of enlightenment and they\xa0also started to crave more of these kinds of experiences, which of course the cult readily offered to them.\nHonestly, these steps outlined above mirror very closely what I personally experienced as part of a Charismatic Christian worship service. We would start out with a high-energy set of songs where people would literally pogo in the front of the room and shout \u201cWoo!\u201d [which created both the hyperventilation effect and the euphoria effect simultaneously], then the worship songs would slow down to a more meditative vibe and we\u2019d stand there deep in a trance with our eyes closed, swaying like trees, and then finally we\u2019d be engulfed in a wave of silent meditation at the end where we laid on the floor or knelt on the ground with our noses in a puddle of tears and snot. That\u2019s when we\u2019d have a vision from God or hear a word from Jesus about something deep and profound in our own personal experience.\n\n\nSo, the question is: Were those experiences \u201creal\u201d or were they predictable physiological effects induced by a lack of oxygen to the brain, euphoric dancing and collective silence?\nI believe the answer is \u201cYes\u201d to both questions.\nSee, I believe that God is real. I also believe that we are spiritual beings having a temporary physical experience. So, it\u2019s not unusual for us, as spiritual beings, to encounter the Divine. The fact that there are methods we can employ to facilitate those spiritual experiences does not negate the experience.\nHere\u2019s another way to look at it: Movies, music, art and poetry have the power to stimulate our emotions. We watch an emotional scene in a film and we start to cry. We hear a beautiful song and we feel our chest expand with joy. We stand in awe of a painting in a museum and we feel connected to the Universe. We hear a line of poetry and we feel as if we can discern the meaning of life, even if we can\u2019t quite put it into words.\nDo those experiences lose meaning because they were induced by music, or art? Hardly. If anything, the power of music and art to jump-start our emotions and remind us of our deeper identity as human beings is precisely why we value them so much. Spiritual experiences are no different.\n\n\nCertainly, we can take a cynical posture \u2013 and many do \u2013 and conclude that our spiritual experiences are merely the result of chemical changes in our bloodstream. For some, the existence of God or any spiritual reality is predefined as a fantasy. In those cases, there is no scientific explanation that could possibly convince them that there is a spiritual reality to be experienced, or a Divine being to be known.\n\n\nThis blog post won\u2019t change their minds.\nBut for some of us, the spiritual reality is possible and the Divine presence is an ongoing experience that we treasure and affirm.\nThe bottom line is: The opposite of Faith is not Doubt, it\u2019s Certainty. Those who believe are not discouraged by doubts. We embrace mystery. In fact, we take great comfort in mystery. What we need isn\u2019t certainty. What we really need is a greater connection with the Divine Mystery that we call \u201cGod\u201d, or \u201cChrist.\u201d\nSo, those Rajneesh cultists were inducing an experience that, I would say, was \u2013 and is \u2013 real. Those people really were hacking their brains to facilitate an actual spiritual connection with God. The problem is \u2013 and the danger for all of us \u2013 is how we define those experiences and what power we allow others to have over us as the result of those experiences.\n\n\nI see no problem with anyone having a spiritual experience, in any context. But I do see a problem whenever we surrender our hearts and minds to other people like ourselves rather than to the Divine Presence we are experiencing.\nFor me, the question is not: \u201cIs this experience real?\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cIs this experience being used by others to manipulate me?\u201d\nJesus said he came to give us an abundant life and that following him would set us free. Those who seek to have power over us are not truly in connection with Christ. His yoke is easy and his burden is light.\nWe can draw near to Him, and if we do, then His promise is to draw near to us.\nThere\u2019s no need for any other mediator between us and God.\nWhat do you think?\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

161,God Will Meet You Now,"April 17, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\nNow is a holy moment. In fact, now is the holiest moment of all. Because now is the exact point in time where you and God are both together in the same place.\nGod is here, now. You are here now. Now is the only time you can ever meet with God.\nPerhaps this is why the scriptures tell us that \u201cNow is the time of God\u2019s favor\u201d and \u201cNow is the day of salvation.\u201d [2 Cor. 6:2]\n\n\n\nYet, for some reason, most of us really don\u2019t spend our time focused on being here now. Instead, we either dwell on the past or we place our hope in the future. By doing this, we refuse to actually be in the present moment and experience the glorious miracle of now.\nA few years ago I got caught in that endless feedback loop myself. I had been laid off from a job I really loved nearly a year previously. All I could do was dream about finding another job situation that mirrored this experience. In fact, I was so focused on recreating the conditions of that previous job that I was unable to let go and receive what God had for me in the present moment. Once I realized that I was allowing that experience in my past to rule my thoughts I let go of that and stopped trying to relive those glory days. That\u2019s what allowed me to move forward.\nWe can also be guilty of living in the \u201cwhat if?\u201d of tomorrow and become a slave to the future. In other words, we put our lives today on hold because we\u2019re waiting for something to happen first. We think that our lives will really begin once we fall in love, or get married, or have children, or get our Master\u2019s degree, or become missionaries, or write that book, or\u2026fill in the blank.\n\n\nThe problem with this, of course, is that by placing all of our attention on tomorrow, we forget to really live in today.\nI can remember thinking that when I graduated from High School I would be a different person. But I wasn\u2019t. I felt the same. Then I thought that I would feel different when my band released our first album. But I didn\u2019t. I was still the same.\nThen I thought that I\u2019d be different when I got licensed and ordained. But I didn\u2019t. I was the same person.\nThen I thought I\u2019d be different after I got married. But that didn\u2019t change either. I was always the same person, no matter what I experienced.\nSo, I eventually let go of those expectations that some future event or condition could really change how I felt or who I was on the inside.\nThe future is always a day away. It\u2019s forever out of our reach.\nThe past is always a memory. We can never really go back there.\nBut now is here no matter what we do. It never goes away. It is always now.\nThat\u2019s the good news. We are citizens of the eternal now.\nIf we embrace this truth, and really start to focus our energies on being intentional about it, we can actually receive this as a gift.\n\n\n\n\nYou see,\xa0God cannot meet you in the past, because you are not in the past. You are here now.\nGod cannot meet you in the future, but you are not in the future. You are here now.\nGod is here now, too. Both of you are here \u2013 now.\nTake a deep breath. Close your eyes. Let yourself really soak in this moment.\nEmbrace the holiness of now and receive it as God\u2019s gift to you.\nNow is the time. The time is now.\nGod will meet you now.\nAre you ready?\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

162,All I Really Know,"April 14, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nLearning to discern the voice of God is challenging, and we don\u2019t always get it right.\nSometimes we get it very, very wrong, in fact.\n\n\n\nIn those moments it can be difficult to maintain our trust in Him because we can assume that He misled us, especially when we had our hopes in whatever we felt like He promised us.\n\n\n\xa0**\nThe most challenging time for our family was when Wendy had a dream that she was pregnant with twins. She was standing in our backyard working with her flowers and she felt like she was having a miscarriage. Her first thought was, \u201cOh no. I\u2019m losing this baby\u201d but immediately she heard the Lord say to her, in her dream: \u201cDon\u2019t say this baby will die if I say it will live.\u201d\n\xa0**\nA few weeks later she realized she was actually pregnant.\n\xa0**\nA few weeks after that she started to lose the baby.\n\xa0**\nPeople came over to our house and prayed over her. They affirmed what she had heard in her dream; that this child would not die but live.\n\xa0**\nSo, we held on tight to those promises, and especially to this dream which God had given to her long before she even realized she was pregnant.\n**\nBut then we lost the baby.\n**\nIt\u2019s hard to describe the sense of loss and betrayal we felt.\n**\nHow could God do this? Why would He give us such a specific dream and promise of life and then take it away from us?\n\n\n**\nWas God being cruel? Was He playing with us? Didn\u2019t He know how we would have interpreted that dream and that promise that the child would not die but live?\n**\nThere were no answers then, only questions.\n**\nWe grieved. We cried. We wrestled with our doubts. We struggled to hang on to our faith in God\u2019s goodness.\n**\nOver time we began to look at all of this through another lens. Wendy had another dream later on that suggested that our daughter was indeed alive and in the presence of Jesus. She took comfort knowing that we would see her \u2013 and the other 5 children we had miscarried \u2013 one day soon.\n**\nBut that experience led us to reassess the way we interpreted God\u2019s voice. Not everything was easy to discern. Not every word was to be taken at face value.\n**\nIn other words, we weren\u2019t so sure about what we knew anymore.\n**\nI recently shared this story with someone and they asked me what to do when you know that God has told you something, but you\u2019re still struggling with doubts?\n**\nAfter thinking about how to respond I had to say this:\n**\n\u201cThe list of things I \u2018know\u2019 is pretty short these days. I can only say that God is good and He loves me. Beyond that, I can\u2019t honestly say I \u201cknow\u201d anything.\u201d\n**\nThis is where we are.\n**\nOur confidence in anything other than God\u2019s goodness and love for us is up for grabs.\n**\nBut because we know that we are loved by a God who is good, we can handle anything else that comes our way.\n**\nLike the man who said to Jesus, \u201cI believe. Help my unbelief!\u201d or Peter who said, \u201cLord, where can we go? You have the words of life\u201d, we can only hold tight to Him, even if we don\u2019t always understand what He is doing.\n**\nSo, hold fast to these simple truths: God is good. He loves you.\n**\n\n\n\nAnything else is up for grabs.\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

163,What\u2019s New? Everything!,"April 9, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nAn essential element of the Messianic promise is this: Nothing will ever be the same again.\nGod makes this clear in Isaiah 65:17 when He says:\n\u201cSee, I will create\xa0new heavens and a new earth.\xa0The former things will not be remembered,\xa0nor will they come to mind.\u201d\n\n\nWhat follows is a long list of contrasts between the way things are, and the way things will be after the Messiah comes.\nIf there was death, there will be life. If there was violence, there will be peace. If there was despair, there will be hope.\nJesus changes everything.\nBest of all, the Messianic promise includes the renewal of humankind itself. So, not only will God make all things new, He will make all people new, as He says through Ezekiel:\n\u201cI will give you a new heart\xa0and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone\xa0and give you a heart of flesh.\u201d [Ezekiel 36:26]\nThe reason why we are made new is so that we can contain the\xa0new life of Christ within, or as Jesus phrases it:\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.\u201d [Matt. 9:17]\nIn other words, we need to be made new so we can receive the spirit of renewal within.\nWe become agents of the new order; carriers of the renewal; catalysts of the resurrection.\n\n\nThis is why Paul says:\n\u201cTherefore, if anyone is in Christ,\xa0the new creation\xa0has come:\xa0The old has gone, the new is here!\u201d [2 Cor. 5:17]\nHonestly, I don\u2019t believe anyone really grasps the magnitude of this statement. The old creation has faded away. There is now, literally, a new heaven and a new earth and a new humanity unleashed upon us.\nElsewhere, Paul says that we who are in Christ are taking off the old self in order \u201cto be made new in the attitude of your minds;\xa0and to put on\xa0the new self,\xa0created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.\u201d [Eph. 4:23-24]\nThis is the entire plan: To remake the world from within, the way a small pinch of yeast spreads to transform the entire lump of dough and slowly begins to rise.\nAs John describes it in his Revelation of Jesus, when the Bride of Christ [that\u2019s us] unites with Jesus here on the Earth, everything begins to change. He and the Father come to make their home in us. Together, we experience the promise of the New Covenant where God\u2019s dwelling is now among us, and where He is our God, and we are His people. From this divine/human connection, God shouts \u201cI am making everything new!\u201d [Rev. 21:5]\n\n\n\n\nThis genetic transformation has already begun. We are the new wineskins that are filled with the new wine. We are the new generation of the resurrection of Christ. We are the New Jerusalem that has come down from God out of heaven. We are the New Temple of God where Christ lives His Spirit. We are the Body of Christ walking around in the world today. We are children of God that all creation eagerly anticipates. [See Romans 8:19]\nBecause Jesus, our Messiah, has come, nothing \u2013 and no one \u2013 will ever be the same again!\nHalleluiah!\n**\n***\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

164,Love Chapter (Remix),"April 5, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nAnd now I will show you the most beautiful way:\nIf I build a church that\u2019s larger than a football stadium but I don\u2019t love people the way God does, I am nothing.\nIf I write books that sell millions of copies and made Oprah\u2019s favorites list, but don\u2019t love my enemies, then I am worth nothing.\n\n\nIf I have a Television show where I take money from the elderly and the weak-minded and twist the scriptures around to promise endless health and a faith without suffering, then I am not of Christ.\nLove is not violent. It does not kill. It does not carry a weapon.\nLove does not shed blood, unless it is bleeding for the sake of others.\nLove is not arrogant. It does not insult.\nLove does not carry a sign full of hateful words. Love never causes others to doubt God\u2019s goodness and mercy.\nLove always transforms, always serves, always gives, always kneels down to touch the outcast, the homeless, the orphan, and the sick.\nLove washes the feet of the proud and the broken alike.\nLove does not withhold mercy from those who do not deserve it because mercy, by definition, is not about who deserves anything. Love freely rains down goodness and blessings and hope upon the hopeless.\nBut where there are wars, they will cease.\nWhere there is violence, there will be peace.\nWhere there is hate, it will pass away.\nFor we know full well that our Lord Jesus Christ has commanded us not to kill. We know that He spoke to us of loving our enemies, and turning the other cheek, and walking the extra mile, and blessing those who curse us, and doing good to those who hate us, and laying down our lives for others, and loving our neighbor \u2013 even if that neighbor hates us with all of his heart.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was a non-disciple, I thought like one, and I acted like one. But when I became a follower of the Prince of Peace, I put away violent things.\nNow, we see but a poor reflection of Christ in ourselves, and in the Church, but one day we will see Him in our own face, and in one another, more clearly.\nAnd now, these three remain: Hate, Arrogance and Love.\nAnd the greatest of these remains to be seen.\n**\nPlease, join me at one of these upcoming events:\n*Organic Church Conference\xa0with Neil Cole, Ross Rohde, Dan Notti and Keith Giles on Saturday, May 12 in Long Beach, CA.\xa0Register here>\n*The Nonviolent Love of Christ: How Loving Our Enemies Saves The World, with Joshua Lawson and Keith Giles on Saturday, June 16 in Portsmouth Ohio.\xa0Register here>\n***\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

165,I Don\u2019t Believe Everything In The Bible (And Neither Do You),"April 5, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nBefore you hit \u201cunfollow\u201d or reach for the pitchforks, let me clarify what I mean by this statement.\n\nThere are dozens of scriptures and ideas in the Bible that even the most devout Biblicist flat out rejects and ignores.\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\nMost Christians do not greet one another with a holy kiss, although Paul commands Christians to do this four times in the New Testament.\n\n\nMost Christians do not forbid women to cut their hair, nor do they consider long hair on men to be sinful; something Paul appears to command churches to enforce in his letter to the Corinthians.\n\n\nMost Christians would not approve of slave-labor, even though Paul affirms the practice of slavery and tells slaves to remain with their masters and masters to be nice to their slaves.\n\n\nMost Christians today would not endorse polygamy, even though the Bible nowhere speaks out against the practice.\n\n\nMost Christians don\u2019t gather with signs at the County Court House to protest divorce, even though Jesus specifically speaks against it and equates it with adultery.\n\n\nSo, obviously, these same Christians who make bold claims about \u201cbelieving everything in the Bible\u201d, outright dismiss many things that this same Bible tells them to do, or not to do.\n\n\n\n\nThat means, Christians really don\u2019t believe everything in the Bible, even if they claim to believe that the Bible is the \u201cWord of God\u201d and infallible.\n\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not trying to argue that Christians today should take a \u201cGod said it, I believe it and that settles it\u201d approach. Not at all. I think it\u2019s a wonderful thing that we\u2019ve continued to think about what the Bible teaches in the light of who Christ is, rather than holding blindly to the letter of the Law.\n\n\nThe driving factor here is the indwelling presence of Jesus. We\u2019re not left with a book to guide us. We have the living Spirit of Christ \u2013 the actual \u201cWord of God\u201d \u2013 living within us.\n\n\nIn other words, over time the Church has slowly begun to see more truth as it is continuously revealed through the eyes, character and heart, of Jesus.\n\n\nOur Lord commands us to love God and to love others as we love ourselves, even to love our enemies and do good to them. So, in light of this radical way of re-thinking everything, we find ourselves realizing that loving people means not owning them as property, and loving one another means not condemning people for their brokenness, and faithfulness to our spouse means not bringing anyone else into the relationship, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThere was a time when society owned other people and treated them as property. Christians in the South could even quote New Testament scriptures to justify owning slaves. But, as the church began to draw nearer to the spirit of Jesus, they realized that everyone is created in God\u2019s image and no one should be bought or sold. The spirit of Christ transformed the letter of the Law to reveal the heart of the Father.\n\n\nThere was a time when polygamy was the norm. No one thought it was weird or wrong. Even the Bible had nothing bad to say about it. But over time, as we began to see things through the eyes of Jesus, we realized that marriage was meant to reflect the relationship between Christ and the Church, and we abandoned those old practices and embraced monogamy.\n\n\n\n\n[SIDEBAR: I\u2019m not even talking here about everything in the Old Covenant scriptures that have all been fulfilled in Christ and have no authority for those under the New Covenant; like offering animal sacrifices, observing the Sabbath, shunning women in their period, stoning homosexuals, etc.]\n**\n\n\nSo, does this mean that Christians can start ignoring parts of the written Word they don\u2019t like? No, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. The pattern I\u2019m pointing to involves drawing nearer and nearer to Jesus and allowing Him to guide us into all Truth by His Spirit. As we experience an increase of light from the indwelling Spirit of Christ, we find ourselves being led away from rules and laws [\u201cdon\u2019t handle, don\u2019t taste, don\u2019t touch\u201d] and closer to the heart of who Jesus is \u2013 and who He is calling us to be.\nMy point is that Jesus is the Truth. He is the Way. He is the living \u201cWord of God\u201d which was made flesh and has come to dwell among \u2013 and within \u2013 us.\n\nFinding Truth involves more than just pointing to a verse in a book and proclaiming, \u201cThe Bible says\u2026\u201d.\n\n**\nIf we have the living Word of God inside of us, we can discern whether or not slavery, or polygamy, or short hair on women, etc. is \u201can abomination\u201d or not. We are not bound by words on a page, we are set free by The Word in our heart.\n\n\n\n\nEverything we believe must be processed through the person of Jesus. If it does not align with who He is, then it is in direct opposition to the \u201cWord of God\u201d and must be conformed to His image.\n**\n\n\nPlease, join me at one of these upcoming events:\n*Organic Church Conference\xa0with Neil Cole, Ross Rohde, Dan Notti and Keith Giles on Saturday, May 12 in Long Beach, CA.\xa0Register here>\n*The Nonviolent Love of Christ: How Loving Our Enemies Saves The World, with Joshua Lawson and Keith Giles on Saturday, June 16 in Portsmouth Ohio.\xa0Register here>\n***\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

166,This Present Reality,"April 2, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nT. Austin Sparks says something in the very beginning of his book \u201cThe School of Christ\u201d which provided a very clear image for me of what I think is \u201coff\u201d about so much of Christianity today.\nHe points out that the prophetic image of a new temple as described to Ezekiel is already fulfilled in Christ, and therefore in His Body [which is the church].\n\n\n\nIn other words, there is nothing \u2013 absolutely nothing \u2013 that would be any different in any way in this present reality if someone were to actually start stacking large stone blocks on top of each other to construct a physical temple in Jerusalem this afternoon, then what we already experience right now because of Christ.\nIf only we could grasp this truth.\nThe image of this temple in Jerusalem as described by Ezekiel, and even later by John in his Revelation,\xa0is a metaphor for the reality that was to come \u2013 and has now already come \u2013 through Jesus our Messiah.\nThe dwelling place of God is now among men, as we read in Revelation 21:3.\nThe rivers of living water that flow from the center of the new city, or the new temple, are the same living waters that Jesus said would flow out of us \u2013 His people \u2013 He Body \u2013 His Temple \u2013 in the Gospel of John:\n\u201cIf anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.\xa0Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, \u2018Out of\xa0his heart will flow rivers of living water.\u2019\u201d (John 7:37-38)\n\u201cWhoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.\xa0Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water\xa0welling up to eternal life.\u201d (John 4:14)\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/04/this-present-reality/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
167,What His Resurrection Means To Me,"March 30, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nWhat does the Resurrection mean to me?\nIt means I will never experience a single moment without Jesus. He will never leave or forsake me. Nothing can separate me from His love.\nImage: Pixabay\nDeath cannot stop this love. Life can\u2019t change it. Angels and demons are powerless against it. Time itself can\u2019t touch it. His love for me endures forever.\n\n\nMy Abba and His Son are joyfully living within me and by the power of the Holy Spirit, I am being transformed into the image of Christ.\nAt this very moment, the lover of my soul and the savior of the Universe lives and breathes within me.\nMy identity is forever bound to Jesus. He is, and always will be, part of me. I will walk with Him \u2013 and He with me \u2013 throughout all eternity.\nFor all my life and eternity after I will continually experience the endless love of Christ that is always higher, wider, longer and deeper than I can fathom.\nI will never breathe another breath without Jesus. My heart will forever beat in time with His.\nIn Him, I live and move and have my being.\nJesus surrounds me, His Spirit covers me. His Presence remains within me for all eternity to come.\nHe delights in me. He is with me. He is for me. He rejoices over me with singing. He quiets me with His love.\nMany waters cannot quench this love. His love hopes all things, endures all things. His Love always protects me. His love never fails.\nHis love never ends. His loves transcends knowledge, and yet I can know it. It is infinitely high and wide and long and deep and yet I can experience it, and be immersed in it, and consumed by it, and transformed by His awesome love.\n\n\nHalleluiah! He loves me! He loves me!\nAnd with His love, I also receive His peace that passes understanding and His joy that is my strength, and best of all \u2013 His Presence.\nI am so loved. Dearly treasured by my Abba. I am His beloved. I am cherished by Him. I am valuable and precious to Jesus. He has never paid a higher price for anything than what He paid to make me His own.\nI am worth dying for. I am worth suffering for. I am worth the shame of the cross.\nFor all eternity to come, I will forever be reminded of how great His love for me was \u2013 and is.\n\n\nHe has loved me with an everlasting love. He has called me His son. He calls me His friend. He has rearranged the Universe to make a place where we can be together.\nHis blood declares \u2013 \u201cYou are mine!\u201d\nHis Resurrection proclaims \u2013 \u201cI am with you always.\u201d\nHis Spirit whispers \u2013 \u201cI am right here with you, and I love you so much more than you can hope or dream or imagine.\u201d\nA love like this required an eternity to fully comprehend and receive.\nWe are being made ready for eternity.

168,Risen?,"March 29, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nWe as Christians have an unusual fascination with the death of Jesus. I know that what Jesus did for us, on the cross, is an astounding act of love and sacrifice. Without this, none of us would have any hope, and yet Paul the Apostle declares that, \u201c..if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.\u201d (I Cor.15:17)\nI wonder if our fascination with his death has something to do psychologically with our view of what it means to be a Christian?\nImage: Pixabay\nFor instance, the modern church, especially in America, can\u2019t seem to go on enough about the death of Jesus. It seems that all the television preachers can talk about is the fact that, \u201cJesus died on the cross for your sins\u201d.\n\n\nWhen a Christian person is interviewed on television or stands to talk about Jesus, inevitably the only thing they can find to say is that, \u201cJesus loves you and he died on the cross for your sins\u201d.\nAt times it all starts to sound monotonous and cliche. I can almost hear the lost saying, \u201cSo what?\u201d\nThe message we send most loudly to the world is the idea that Jesus died.\nEven the most prominent media message in our lifetime, Mel Gibson\u2019s mega-evangelistic \u201cPassion Of The Christ\u201d, which was dubbed \u201cThe Greatest Evangelical Message in Two Thousand Years\u201d, was all about the death of Jesus. The resurrection scene at the end was so vague and quick that most of us, even those of us who know the story, were left going, \u201cHuh? What just happened?\u201d\nAt Easter this overt focus on the death of Jesus is most noticeable. For me, when we spend those two weeks before and after Easter talking about the irrefutable fact of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, it almost seems strange. Like, \u201cOh yeah! He DID rise from the dead, didn\u2019t he?\u201d, as if this most historically provable event is something we need to be reminded of, but only once a year.\n\n\nThis has got me thinking. Why is it that we focus so much on the death of Jesus and very little on the resurrection of Jesus? I mean, why isn\u2019t the resurrection the main thing we talk about? Why don\u2019t we go around proclaiming that \u201cJesus is Risen!\u201d and argue with people about the fact that there\u2019s no refuting the fact of Easter?\nHere\u2019s my theory:\nWe, the Church, are the Body of Christ. We are the physical representation of Jesus in the world today, and I think we\u2019re more comfortable being the \u201cBody at Rest\u201d than the \u201cBody in Motion\u201d.\xa0\nAs the Body of Jesus, we\u2019re more comfortable in the dark of the tomb, wrapped in our own shroud, meditating on this death of our Lord, with the stone rolled shut across the door.\nWe ignore that what we are called to do, as the living Body of Jesus, is to go out and proclaim, demonstrate and testify with our lives the awesome miracle that \u201cJesus is Alive!\u201d and that we are living examples of this fact.\nWhat I long for is the day when we are bold enough to declare, as one people, with one voice, that Jesus is Alive, and that our conduct in the world would bear witness to this fact.\n\n\n\n\nOur inactivity, our apathy, our aversion to serve others and live out the compassion of Jesus, sadly proclaims that Jesus is dead.\nIt\u2019s when we live for Him, when we continue to love the way He did, when our lives are in sync with His, that we proclaim by our actions that, yes, indeed, Jesus is really alive!\nIs Jesus really alive? Has He really come to live in your life? And how would anyone know this to be true if you never actually demonstrated the life and love and ministry of Jesus in your own life?\nDo we, as individual followers of Jesus, feel safer within the quiet of the tomb? Or are we willing, even eager, to roll away the stone and begin to live the truth of the power of the Gospel?\nIf we, the Body of Jesus, do not act as a living Jesus would, within this world, loving those He loved, sharing with those He spent time with, continuing His ministry of transformation, then we do not demonstrate that Jesus is alive, we simply testify that He has died.\nWhat we must do is to wake ourselves from our slumber, shake off the apathy, and begin to proclaim, with our own lives, that Jesus is truly alive.\n\u201cI tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.\u201d- John 14:12\n\n\n\u201cWhoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.\u201d- 1 John 2:6\nHe is Risen!

169,The Body of Jesus,"March 28, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nThe body of Jesus was taken down from the cross. It was cold; lifeless; heavy.\nThey washed his body clean with water and anointed it with spices, wrapping it in a shroud from head to toe.They laid his body in the cold, dark tomb and rolled the stone over the door. In the silence that followed, the body of Jesus did not stir.\xa0\n\n\nImage: Pixabay\nOutside of the tomb, life went on as usual. Most people celebrated the Passover feast with their families, laughed with their friends, played with their children, argued with their neighbors, went through their normal, everyday lives, oblivious to the significance of the cross.\nAs the lifeless body of Jesus rested in the tomb, people wept for lack of hope.\nAs Jesus lay motionless, they suffered the unbearable pain of loneliness.\xa0As Jesus\u2019 body did nothing, they fainted from hunger.\xa0As the body was unmoved, they cried out for mercy but no one answered them.\xa0Later, people would claim that Jesus was alive. But when those in pain looked, the body of Christ was motionless.Some shouted that Jesus had risen from the dead. But then some of those who were hungry noticed that the body of Jesus wasn\u2019t concerned with their needs.Others waved banners and sang songs about the resurrection of Jesus. But then those in prison wondered why the body of Jesus was still wrapped up and hiding behind a large stone wall.\n\n\nIs the body of Jesus alive today? Or is the body of Jesus still nestled in the dark of the cold tomb?\n\n\n\xa0\nWe are the body of Jesus. If we want the world to know that Jesus is alive today, we are the physical evidence of his resurrection. If Jesus lives in us, then He must live through us.\n\xa0\nIf Jesus was truly alive today, where would He be found? In the houses of the poor; beside the beds of the HIV infected; holding the hands of the homeless; comforting the lonely; visiting the prisoner.\n\xa0\nAnd if Jesus is there, wouldn\u2019t it be strange for His body not to be there, too?\n**\nJoin me at one of these upcoming events:\nOrganic Church Conference\xa0with Neil Cole, Ross Rohde, Dan Notti and Keith Giles on Saturday, May 12 in Long Beach, CA.\xa0Register here>\nThe Nonviolent Love of Christ: How Loving Our Enemies Saves The World, with Joshua Lawson and Keith Giles on Saturday, June 16 in Portsmouth Ohio.\xa0Register here>\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

170,The Failed Insurrection on Palm Sunday,"March 23, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nOn the day that the Passover Lamb was traditionally selected, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey. Spontaneously, the people along the road began to wave palm branches and shout \u201cHosanna!\u201d but what\u2019s really going on might surprise you. First of all, the people received Jesus as a prophet (Matt. 21:11) but not as the Messiah.\n\n\n\nThis event was prophesied in Zechariah 9:9:\n\u201cRejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\u201d\nThe truth is that the rest of that prophecy was about the Messiah coming as an agent of peace:\n\xa0\n\u201cI will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the warhorses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.\u201d (v. 10)\n\xa0\nNotice that Jesus weeps over the fact that they do not understand what his mission is when he responds to their adulation and palm-waving with this statement:\n\xa0\n\u201cAs he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, \u201cIf you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace\u2014but now it is hidden from your eyes. The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God\u2019s coming to you.\u201d (Luke 19:41-44)\n\n\n\xa0\nSee, the fact that they were waving palm branches is significant. Those palm branches were a direct throwback to the Maccabean period when the triumphant Jewish warriors rode into Jerusalem and the people celebrated their victory over the Seleucids, which incidentally was followed immediately by a ritual cleansing of the temple. At that time the people waved palm branches as a symbol of military conquest over an oppressive enemy. By waving those palm branches, the people are saying that they are ready for war. They are ready for the blood of the Romans to be spilled in an uprising that they hope Jesus will lead them in. It\u2019s no different than when Peter cut off the servant\u2019s ear in Gethsemane and received the rebuke from Jesus.\n\xa0\nToday we usually read that passage about the people shouting \u201cHosanna!\u201d as an indication that the people received Jesus as their King. But on the contrary, the people were rejecting Jesus as their personal, spiritual Messiah and calling out for him to be their political, militant Messiah. When they shout \u201cHosanna!\u201d which means \u201cSave us!\u201d they are demanding him to lead the charge of attack against the Romans.\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\nThis is why Jesus weeps over the people. He knows that their hearts are far from God\u2019s heart. They want war. He has come to bring peace. They reject him and his mission. They can\u2019t receive him for who he is. They cannot submit to him as he is \u2013 a humble servant riding on a donkey \u2013 they only want him to meet their expectations for a warrior who will set them free from earthly oppression, but they are unwilling to be set free from their own lusts and desires.\nSee, this was the day that the Passover Lamb was traditionally chosen to take away the sins of the people. On this day, the people rejected the Lamb because they wanted a Lion instead.\nIronically, the people of Jerusalem would receive the very punishment they sought to bring upon the Romans, as Jesus predicts in Luke 19:41-44, and later in Luke 21:5-38. This is why Jesus weeps. He knows that in AD 70 the Romans will surround the city and kill everyone and destroy the very temple he is about to go and cleanse.\n\xa0\nThe cleansing of the temple echoes the Maccabean cleansing roughly 200 years before, but when Jesus cleanses the temple this time it is more than ceremonial. Instead, he chases out the corrupt money changers and the sellers of doves who were exploiting the poor, and he clears the floor that was intended to be a place of prayer for the nations.\n\n\n\xa0\nWhen you wave a palm branch on Palm Sunday, you should know that it\u2019s a symbol of military power and conquest, not a symbol of humble devotion to the King who rides on a donkey to reign as the Prince of Peace in every human heart.\n**\nJoin me at one of these upcoming events:\nOrganic Church Conference\xa0with Neil Cole, Ross Rohde, Dan Notti and Keith Giles on Saturday, May 12 in Long Beach, CA.\xa0Register here>\nThe Nonviolent Love of Christ: How Loving Our Enemies Saves The World, with Joshua Lawson and Keith Giles on Saturday, June 16 in Portsmouth Ohio.\xa0Register here>\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

171,What the Bible Clearly Says,"March 21, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most common phrases I think I\u2019ve ever heard from Christians when it comes to any conversation where people want to use the Bible to justify their position: \u201cThe Bible clearly says\u2026\u201d\nWhat follows is usually a quotation of a certain number of verses that support that person\u2019s view, as if the conversation is now over. But, of course, the other person can also say, \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong because the Bible clearly says\u2026\u201d as they quote their own batch of scriptures that appear to support their particular viewpoint.\n\n\n\nThe truth is, these sorts of conversations are usually over long before they begin because neither side is really listening to the other side. Both people have already made up their mind what they believe \u201cthe Bible clearly says\u201d and so they are not interested in being distracted from that conclusion by anyone else.\nTo some Christians, this presents a conundrum. They wonder who is right and who is wrong. They need to have it all spelled out so that everyone is under the proper Biblical Authority. To them what we need to do is to \u201ctake the Bible seriously\u201d and \u201crightly divide the Word of Truth\u201d because, in their minds, there is only one way to interpret the Scriptures: The Right Way.\nAbove all, their concern is that none of us should fall into the trap of applying our own personal slant to the Scriptures. What we need is for someone to tell us what the Bible says so we can avoid \u201creading into the text\u201d.\nBut, here\u2019s the deal: Having a hardcore stance on Biblical Authority does not eliminate the possibility that we might start following our own personal slant on the scriptures. It simply means that we are more likely to be blind to how our personal biases influence the way we interpret scripture.\n\n\nIn other words, what we mostly follow is our interpretation of the Scriptures, not the Scripture itself. If we fail to admit that, then we live in our blindspot and accuse everyone else of doing exactly what we ourselves are guilty of.\nThe honest truth is: There is almost nothing that the Bible \u201cclearly says\u201d. What it does is represent a variety of views and perspectives about who God is and what God is like. Our challenge \u2013 and everyone\u2019s personal challenge \u2013 is to accurately determine what voices in the Bible we should agree with and which voices in the Bible to be more skeptical about.\nThis is why I advocate for a Christ-centric reading of the Bible. Because Jesus is the best picture we could ever have of who God is and what God is like. There are nearly a dozen scriptures that affirm this truth: Jesus came to reveal to us who the Father really is.\nWhy was this necessary? Because everyone before Jesus was unaware of who exactly the Father really was and what His character was actually like. Jesus settled the question once and for all: God is like Jesus.\nOr, as Jesus put it: \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen me, you have seen the Father\u201d \u2013 Jesus (John 14:9)\n\n\nSo, if we have seen Jesus, then we have seen the clearest and most accurate vision of God anyone could possibly ever have.\nThe Gospel of John stresses this truth in the strongest terms possible when it says:\n\u201cNo one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is God Himself, and is in the closest relationship to the Father, He has made Him known.\u201d (John 1:18)\nOur problem is compounded when we try to read the Bible as if it were one single book (it\u2019s not), written by one single author (it\u2019s not) and conclude that somehow all of these different voices must somehow be reconciled into one solitary voice where every part \u201cagrees\u201d with every other part.\n\n\nThis is called the \u201cFlat Bible\u201d approach and I think it\u2019s the root of many unhealthy perspectives about God.\nInstead of taking that approach (something I did for most of my life) I now suggest taking the Jesus-Centered approach where everything we read is filtered through the lens of Christ.\nI believe this is exactly what the Apostle Paul himself did and also why he said:\n\u201cBut their minds were made dull,\xa0for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant\xa0is read.\xa0It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.\u201d (2 Cor. 3:14)\n\n\nSee, if we try to understand the scriptures apart from Christ, then we will arrive at a different conclusion than if we read them through the revealed character of the Father\u2019s heart as seen in Jesus.\nSo, when we read and study the Bible, I think it\u2019s important to do a few things:\nFirst, we need to admit to ourselves that we bring our own biases and ideas to the Scriptures when we read them.\nSecond, we need to accept the fact that we might be wrong about some of our assumptions about the Scriptures and what they\u2019re saying to us.\nThird, we need to admit that we might have something to learn from others who look at things from another perspective.\nFourth, we need to understand that the best way for us to look at the scriptures is through the lens of Jesus since He is the best picture we have of who God really is.\n\u201cNo one knows the Father except for the Son and anyone to whom the Son reveals Him.\u201d \u2013 Jesus (Matt. 11:27)\nThere\u2019s a lot we can learn if we listen to one another. There\u2019s even more we can learn if we start by assuming that we have something to learn. But everyone can learn more about who God is by looking at Jesus. He is the Word of God made flesh who now dwells among \u2013 and within \u2013 us all.\n\n\n\u201cThe Law came through Moses. But Grace and Truth came through Jesus Christ.\u201d (John 1:17)\n**\nJoin me at one of these upcoming events:\nOrganic Church Conference\xa0with Neil Cole, Ross Rohde, Dan Notti and Keith Giles on Saturday, May 12 in Long Beach, CA.\xa0Register here>\nThe Nonviolent Love of Christ: How Loving Our Enemies Saves The World, with Joshua Lawson and Keith Giles on Saturday, June 16 in Portsmouth Ohio.\nRegister here>\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

172,Our Forgotten Power,"March 20, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nWhen it comes to love, many Christians have a pretty low opinion of it. Sure, it\u2019s great. But there\u2019s so much more they would rather focus on. Things like Justice and Wrath, and Sovereignty and Judgment, for example, are much more important to them than love.\nTo Christians like this, the Gospel is more about escaping the eternal flames of hell than knowing a God who loves us enough to lay down His life for the world.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve actually had Christians leave our house church fellowship because we spend too much time talking about love. One man left me a long voicemail message about how he was leaving our group because we only wanted to focus on God\u2019s love. He then went on to suggest that God\u2019s love is also about punishing sinners who stray from His law.\nThis is not an isolated case. Truth be told, many Christians are offended by this continual focus on love. They don\u2019t want to sing about it. They don\u2019t want to meditate on it. They don\u2019t want to believe that God\u2019s love is the most important thing.\nTo them, love is a squishy, mushy, mamby-pamby syrup that is best taken in small doses.\nWhat\u2019s more, they tend to see love as a sign of weakness and connect it to what they term as an \u201cover-emphasis on emotions.\u201d What they want is to spend more time on doctrines, and to focus on the \u201cWord of God\u201d which, in their terminology, is code for \u201cThe Holy Bible\u201d, not what the Bible says it is, which is Jesus.\nI started to reflect on this phenomenon recently. I wondered why so many Christians today seem to undervalue the love of God. Why do they see it as being synonymous with weakness and human emotion?\n\n\nI want to ask them: \u201cIs God weak?\u201d\nOf course not. God is the most powerful being in the Universe. I mean, heck, God created the Universe and holds everything in it together. Of course, God is powerful.\nYet, God is love. So, if God is love, then how can love be weak or powerless?\nAnother question I\u2019d like to ask is: \u201cWhy would a Christian trust in any other power?\u201d\nMost Christians who guffaw at the power of love tend to favor the power of physical weapons. They trust in guns, or the State, to protect them. They would rather put their faith in the power to inflict death on others than to trust in the power of God\u2019s love.\nUnderstand something: The power of a gun is rooted in the power of fear and death. The power of intimidation is tied to use of force and the threat of violence.\nBut don\u2019t we know that God\u2019s perfect love casts out fear? Do we really believe that? Maybe not. But if we do believe that love renders fear powerless, then we must admit that all weapons are useless.\nNow, those who properly wield the power of love are more powerful than those who brandish weapons of fear and death. However, like anyone else, we need to learn how to use our weapons skillfully in order to be effective.\n\n\n\n\nNo one can just buy a machine gun or a high-powered sniper rifle and expect to be an expert marksman without any training. No one can purchase a katana or a compound bow and become proficient with these weapons without years of practice and hours of instruction.\nLearning to use the power of love is no exception. If we want to learn how to use the most powerful force in the Universe effectively, it will take an entire lifetime to hone our skills and see results.\nThis is why we need to spend hours together focused on the love of God.\nRemember: \u201cThe only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\u201d (Gal. 5:6)\nGod is love. There is nothing stronger.\nNo power in heaven above or hell below is greater than pure love.\nLove disarms us. Love transforms us. Love overcomes hate. Love defies the grave.\nLove is wider, higher, longer and deeper than anything we can comprehend.\nWe cannot ever be separated from this love. Nothing can ever take it from us. It is eternally embedded within every person\u2019s heart who abides in Christ.\nAll human power is based on fear and death. God\u2019s love is the ultimate power that erases fear and conquers death.\n\n\nSo, like it or not, anyone who chooses the power of death and fear has already lost the war.\nLove is the greatest power in the Universe. Love created the Universe. Love sustains the Universe.\nWithout love we are nothing.\nAnd the greatest thing about love is that love never fails.\n**\nJoin me at one of these upcoming events:\nOrganic Church Conference\xa0with Neil Cole, Ross Rohde, Dan Notti and Keith Giles on Saturday, May 12 in Long Beach, CA.\xa0Register here>\nThe Nonviolent Love of Christ: How Loving Our Enemies Saves The World, with Joshua Lawson and Keith Giles on Saturday, June 16 in Portsmouth Ohio.\nRegister here>\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

173,There Are No Mansions In Heaven,"March 19, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\u201cIn My Father\u2019s house are many rooms (dwelling places); if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.\u201d(John 14:2-3)\n\nMost of my life I\u2019ve understood this verse as being about Heaven. But recently someone pointed out to me that the phrase \u201cmy Father\u2019s house\u201d is used by Jesus exclusively throughout the other Gospels to refer to the Temple.For example, early on in Luke when Jesus is separated from his parents for three days they find him teaching in the Temple. When they finally find him Jesus says, \u201cDidn\u2019t you know I would be in my Father\u2019s house?\u201d (Luke 2:48-50)Also, when Jesus clears the Temple of those who sell doves he declares, \u201cstop making My Father\u2019s house a place of business.\u201d (John 2:15-17)",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/03/no-mansions-in-heaven/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian

175,A Room Full of Jesus,"March 14, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\u201cIf Jesus were alive today\u2026\u201d\nThis is how the question begins. It doesn\u2019t matter what comes next. The point is that Christians keep asking like \u201cIf Jesus was here today\u2026.\u201d which betrays the deeper problem: They don\u2019t realize that Jesus is here today.\nJesus is alive in every single person who loves Him:\n\n\n\u201cIf anyone loves me my Father and I will come to them and make our home in them.\u201d \u2013 Jesus [John 14:23]\n\u201cIf you abide in me then I will abide in you.\u201d \u2013 Jesus [John 15:4]\nNot only is Jesus alive in us right now, but he also promised never to leave us:\n\u201cI will never leave you, nor forsake you.\u201d Jesus [Hebrews 13:5]\nHow can Jesus come back if he never left and if he is already living within us right now?\nOn Sunday, our house church family gathered together as we always do. Our practice is to wait in silence as we experience the presence of Christ in our midst; the one who told us that whenever two or more are gathered in His name, He would be present among us; and as we sat in silence I realized that we were in a room full of Jesus.\nChrist is alive in each of us. He abides in us. We abide in Him. He is \u201cthe one in whom we all live and move and have our being.\u201d [Acts 17:28] We are His Body and \u201cthe fullness of Him who fills everything in every way.\u201d [Eph. 1:23]\nWe are the incarnation of Christ in the world today. As Jesus was sent into the world, He has now sent us. [John 20:21]\n\n\nWe are His hands, His feet, His voice, His heart, His arms, His legs, His face and His smile to everyone we meet.\nThis changes everything.\nIt means that you and I are what we are waiting for.\nSee, since Jesus is here now \u2013 alive within each of us \u2013 that means that all Creation is eagerly awaiting and inwardly groaning for us to realize this truth and start living out our new identity in Christ:\n\u201cFor the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God\xa0to be revealed.\u201d (Romans 8:19)\n\n\nPlease note: Paul does not say that the creation is waiting for Jesus to return and make everything better.\nRead it again: He says that all creation is waiting for us \u2013 the children of God \u2013 to be revealed for who we are (or better yet, to reveal who is alive within us.)\nIf Heaven is where God is, and if God [in Christ] is living within us, then this means Heaven is within you.\n\u201cFor, behold, the Kingdom of God is within you.\u201d \u2013 Jesus [Luke 17:21]\nThis means that we are the people we have been waiting for.\n\n\nJesus is here now. He is alive within us. He will never leave.\nNow, let\u2019s let Him be revealed within us so that all creation can finally receive the joy, peace, patience, kindness, mercy, grace, and most of all the love that we all so desperately need.\nWe are a room full of Jesus.\nStep outside and shine.\n**\nPlease join me at one of these upcoming events:\nOrganic Church Conference\xa0with Neil Cole, Ross Rohde, Dan Notti and Keith Giles: Saturday, May 12 in Long Beach, CA.\xa0Register here>\nThe Nonviolent Love of Christ: How Loving Our Enemies Saves The World, with Joshua Lawson and Keith Giles: Saturday, June 16 in Portsmouth Ohio.\nRegister here>\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

176,A Father\u2019s Love,"March 12, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nAfter a recent gathering, the woman whose home we were meeting in (a total stranger) asked if she could pray over Wendy and me.\nOf course, we said, \u201cYes.\u201d\nAs she prayed for us, it was clear that she had several specific words of encouragement for both Wendy and myself. One thing she\xa0shared was that God looked at me and was very pleased. But honestly, as she prayed these things I sat there in disbelief.\n\n\nI did not accept this in my heart because when I think about what God must feel when He looks at me all I come up with is \u201cdisappointment\u201d.\nAll I can see is how much I\u2019ve blown it and how far I\u2019ve missed the mark.\nStill, the word she gave us was very beautiful and touching. We thanked her for her blessing, but deep down I wasn\u2019t buying it.\nLater that night I prayed and asked the Lord, \u201cIf what she said was really what you think of me and how you feel about me, I need you to confirm it through some other witness.\u201d\nThe next evening, my oldest son was sitting at our computer working on his homework. I felt an urge to surprise him with a blessing, so I took my brand new noise-canceling headphones and placed them over his head as he worked. Then I set my iPod to one of his favorite songs and started to play it. He looked up at me, smiled, and nodded his head to the music.\nAs I left the room, I distinctly heard the Lord whisper to me, \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel about you, my son. I just love you. I love blessing you. I love you because you are made in my image, not because of what you\u2019ve done, or what you fail to do. I just love you, Keith.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t help crying tears of joy as these words washed over me.\nSuddenly, a memory from the week that my son was born flashed into my mind. He slept between Wendy and me for those first few days after we brought him home from the hospital. One morning I woke up before either of them and I rolled over and looked at my newborn son sleeping peacefully next to me. Out of nowhere, I experienced an overwhelming flood of love for him.\nWhy? I wondered. Why do I love him so much? He hasn\u2019t spoken a word. He hasn\u2019t done anything for me. He couldn\u2019t if he wanted to. But my love for him was strong and overpowering and endless. At that moment I knew I would die for him without a second thought. I knew I would do anything necessary to protect him, to bless him, to show him this invincible\xa0love that was swelling up inside of me.\nIt was then that I heard God whisper to me, \u201cThat\u2019s how much I love you, my son. You were made in my image. When I look at you, I see my child and I am overcome with love.\u201d\nThe memory of that experience, combined with this fresh reminder of His enduring love was just so beautiful to me. All I could do was say, \u201cThank you, Abba.\u201d\n\n\nHe loves me. Now I finally believe it.\n**\nJoin me at one of these upcoming events:\nOrganic Church Conference with Neil Cole, Ross Rohde, Dan Notti and Keith Giles: Saturday, May 12 in Long Beach, CA.

177,Are We Already Living In A Dystopian Society?,"March 8, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nMany American Christians are convinced that the Second Amendment is necessary to prevent the US Government from ever imposing tyranny upon its citizens. Should the day ever come, everyone needs to be well-armed and prepared to overthrow the oppressive government and impose another, more freedom-loving one, they say.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a handy test to let you know when your government might be approaching this threshold:\nIf your Government is spying on your\xa0phone calls,\xa0email,\xa0and\xa0text communications,\xa0\xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\nIf your Government\xa0executes its own citizens without a trial or even formal criminal charges, \xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\n\n\nIf your Government\xa0imprisons journalists who attempt to expose their war crimes,\xa0\xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\nIf your Government has been at\xa0war for 214 years out of the last 235, then you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\nIf your Government\xa0hires,\xa0or threatens journalists in order to have them\xa0write false news stories, and even\xa0film fake execution videos\xa0that advance their propaganda, \xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\n\n\nIf your\xa0daily news shows are filled with a combination of trivial entertainment\xa0and stories about why you should\xa0remain fearful of a variety of dangers\xa0all around you, \xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\nIf your nation\xa0currently imprisons more of its citizens than any other nation on the face of the planet,\xa0\xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\nIf your local police are\xa0carrying automatic weapons,\xa0driving armored military vehicles\xa0and indiscriminately\xa0killing innocent,\xa0unarmed people on a daily basis,\xa0\xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\n\n\nIf your Government is\xa0one of the largest military forces on the planet, you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\nIf your Government\xa0spends more on the military than the other 8 largest nations\xa0on earth, you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\nIf more people in your nation are currently on\xa0anti-depressant medications\xa0than\xa0any other nation on earth, \xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\n\n\nIf more than\xa050 percent of the children in your nation are living below the poverty line, \xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\n\n\nIf\xa0large corporations have more power over the laws, the policies, the courts, and the politicians than you \u2013 a tax paying, registered voter,\xa0\xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\nIf the most popular \u201cnews\u201d source for most people in your country is\xa0actually a comedy show that routinely exposes the truth about your Dystopian society, \xa0you might be living in a Dystopian Society.\n\n\nSo, how did your nation score? Chances are, you may start to realize that your nation is already oppressing you, lying to you, exploiting you, manipulating you, and not representing your interests at all.\nIs it time to rally the militia and start the revolution? Probably not. Mainly because there\u2019s no way on earth you and your buddies \u2013 no matter how \u201cwell-regulated\u201d you may be \u2013 are capable of defeating the most technologically-advanced military force in the history of our planet.\nUnless you\u2019ve got a few thousand armed drones, a fleet of attack helicopters, a squadron or two of jet fighter planes and a sizable nuclear arsenal, your little revolution will be over before it can really begin.\nHere\u2019s what I recommend: The Gospel.\nI know, I know. It sounds so weak in comparison to the bombs and the tanks and the missiles, not to mention the NSA, the FBI, the CIA and the secret prisons. But here\u2019s the deal: The love of Jesus changes people. It transforms them from the inside out. It makes them new again. This Gospel is a highly-effective, long-term, world-changing virus designed by the Greatest Mind in the Universe. It has the power to make every weapon useless and render every world power powerless.\n\n\nAs a follower of Jesus, I am a subversive agent of a Kingdom with unlimited powers.\nMy mission is to overthrow this empire from within and to unravel its systems and re-boot the culture.\nThis is accomplished by introducing the Gospel virus into the existing mainframe of reality. This \u201cMetanoia Class\u201d program is designed to re-write the code of our thinking. It has the power to re-wire hearts, reprogram minds, and transform human behaviors.\nThe purpose of this Gospel is to increase the number of radicalized agents into our culture and exponentially advance the range and effect of the Metanoia program.\nOur leader has given us access to an unlimited source of life and power. Our lines of communication with him cannot be tapped, traced or interrupted. We can receive messages from our source at any time, at any place, regardless of access to electricity, infrastructure or technology.\nOne by one, we are now in the process of changing the world from within. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, we are transforming people from darkness into glorious light. Those who formerly walked in the shadows are now awakening to the inescapable truth. Every second of every day, people around the globe turn from walking in the way of this world and begin to follow the way of life contained in the Metanoia program.\n\n\nThose who are infected by this unique virus have begun to think different, and to act different, than other humans around them. They begin to take on the same heart and mind and perspective of our leader, Y\u2019Shua of Nazareth; loving those who hate them; forgiving those who seek to harm them; seeing everyone as a potential brother or sister and a future operative in the program.\nWe are not alone. Our numbers are legion. Our methods are varied, but nonetheless subtle and unstoppable by any government, law or threat known to man.\nThe weaker we grow, the more powerful we become. The more you oppose us, the greater our effectiveness.\nOur victory is assured.\nWe have outlasted every empire for the last 2,000 years. We have endured persecution, torture, and even death. We may die, but our mission carries forward. No force on earth, or even the entire universe, can stop us, or defeat us, or destroy us.\nOur lives are already lost. We have surrendered all to this single purpose and calling. Our death was accounted for on the day we embarked on this mission.\n\n\nWe have no fear. All fear has been erased by an irresistible love that permeates our existence. We are guided by this love and fully compelled that it alone is the hope for all life on this planet.\nWe have no country. We owe no allegiance to any nation, state or ideology other than that of our King.\nWe have no armory. The weapons we employ are love, compassion, service, mercy, and grace. Combined with prayer, hope, trust, and faith, these are all we need to accomplish our goals.\nMake no mistake, this world is fading away. A new world is coming. Behold, the kingdoms of this world have become the Kingdom of our God.\nNothing you can do will change this. The insurgency will prevail.\nJoin us and live.\n**\nWant to learn how to change the world with love?

178,Learning To Love,"March 8, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nI can remember when my oldest son Dylan was in first grade. He came home one day and told us about a boy in his class who was choking him and kicking him at recess.\nAt first, I was enraged. I could only think of how to get that kid kicked out of school, or how to talk to the school principal about protecting my son. I even considered putting my son in a karate class.\n\n\nInstead, my wife and I sat down with my son before bedtime each night and prayed for this boy together. We talked about what this boy must be going through at home. We prayed for his parents, and for his brothers and sisters. We asked Jesus to change this boy\u2019s heart.\nWe also talked to Dylan about how he should try to avoid being alone at recess. We encouraged him to go to his teachers if he saw this boy coming after him again, and we explained to him that Jesus wants us to love those who mistreat us.\nThis process of praying for the bully at school took several weeks. Eventually, my son had a birthday party. He invited every kid in his class, including this boy who had bullied him.\nDuring the party, this boy was included in every game. He sat next to my son as he blew out his candles. He was treated as an honored guest and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 as one of my son\u2019s friends.\nOur whole family, gave this boy a very clear message: We don\u2019t hate you. We really, really love you.\nI think this party was the tipping point, because, after this, the boy no longer bullied Dylan at recess. He didn\u2019t treat anyone else this way either. The love my son had shown him really did transform him. It touched his heart and changed his behavior.\n\n\nThis is sort of the entire point.\n\u201cIf you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even \u2018sinners\u2019 love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even \u2018sinners\u2019 do that. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even \u2018sinners\u2019 lend to \u2018sinners,\u2019 expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.\u201d \u2013 Luke 6:32\nJesus takes the time to contrast the love the world has with the love that God demonstrates to us. In comparison, the love of the world is nothing special. The evilest among us can love the ones who are loving them. Big deal. I\u2019m sure we could find a serial killer who loves his Mom and a rapist who loves his best friend. Even a racist loves someone.\nSo what?\nAs followers of Jesus, we are called to demonstrate the amazing, unprecedented, unexpected, over-the-top kind of love that Jesus has lavished upon us. Why? For two reasons.\n\n\nFirst, so that even the most evil person can experience the undeserved kindness and mercy of God.\nSecondly, to teach you and me how to die to ourselves and to become more like Jesus every day.\nSee, the command that Jesus gives us to love our enemies is intended not only to change the hearts of sinners but to change you and I as well.\nNo, this is not so we can become the world\u2019s doormat. What Jesus intends is for His disciples to take advantage of any opportunity to demonstrate love to those who need it most.\n\n\nWe cannot love this way on our own. We just can\u2019t. The only way we can follow Jesus and obey his command to love those who are trying to harm us is if we learn to abide in Christ daily. We first have to become transformed by His love. Then, and only then, can we share this love that transforms us with those who have never known love at all.\nIn the book, \u201cThe Grace of Giving\u201d, author Stephen Olford tells the story of a Baptist pastor during the American Revolution named Peter Miller. Miller lived in a small town called Ephrata, Pennsylvania, and one of his dearest friends was a guy named George Washington. (Maybe you\u2019ve heard of him?)\n\n\nIn the town of Ephrata, there also lived a spiteful troublemaker named Michael Wittman, who did all he could to oppose and humiliate Mr. Miller.\nOne day Michael Wittman was arrested for treason and sentenced to death. When he heard the news Peter Miller set out Philadelphia to plead for the life of his enemy.\nAfter walking seventy miles \u2013 on foot \u2013 Miller petitioned his friend, General Washington, to spare Wittman\u2019s life.\n\u201cNo, Peter,\u201d General Washington said. \u201cI cannot grant you the life of your friend.\u201d\n\u201cMy friend?\u201d exclaimed the old preacher. \u201cHe\u2019s not my friend. In fact, he is the bitterest enemy I have.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d cried Washington. \u201cYou\u2019ve walked seventy miles to save the life of an enemy? That puts the matter in different light. I\u2019ll grant your pardon.\u201d\nAnd he did.\nThat day, Peter Miller and Michael Wittman walked back home to Ephrata together. When they arrived home, they were no longer enemies. They were friends.\nAs amazing as that story is, the bottom line is that Peter Miller had a different perspective when it came to difficult people, trials and persecution. He saw those things \u2013 not as battles to win \u2013 but as opportunities to love like Jesus loves.\n\n\nYou and I are expected to do the same.\n\u201cDo not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because\xa0to this you were called\xa0so that you may inherit a blessing.\u201d \u2013 1 Peter 3:9\nAs followers of Jesus, you and I are living examples of the redemptive, transformative power of undeserved kindness and love.\nI pray that we can begin to see difficult people and uncomfortable circumstances in this new light. I pray that in the worst of situations, you and I might crucify our flesh and bury our pride. I pray that when others insult us and mock us, we (the followers of Jesus), might be filled with the Spirit of the Living God and demonstrate to those who hate us most that the love of Jesus is truly powerful enough to change hearts and lives.\nI pray this for myself most of all.\nPeace.\n**\nOhio residents: Join me in Portsmouth, OH for \u201cThe Nonviolent Love of Christ: How Loving Our Enemies Saves The World\u201d on Saturday, June 16.

179,Contradictory Christianity,"March 2, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nI typically have two types of arguments online with other Christians: One is about whether or not Islam is a peaceful religion and the other is about how Jesus was absolutely not a pacifist Messiah.\nSo, in the same breath I can be in a conversation with Christians who scream at me about how Jesus was not nonviolent and totally wants them to own guns, kill terrorists and open carry, and then turn around and have another conversation with those same Christians about how their faith is a peaceful religion and Islam is a violent religion.\n\n\nIt\u2019s kind of insane.\nThese Christians typically defend their violent Messiah by pointing out that Jesus told His disciples to \u201cgo and buy a sword\u201d and that He turned over the tables in the Temple and chased out the moneychangers with a whip, and that He said \u201cI came not to bring peace, but a sword!\u201d and then typically they wind everything up by assuring me that when Jesus returns He will bring some serious whup-ass on His enemies.\nHowever, these same Christians will also argue that Islam is violent by quoting verses from the Quran that command gruesome killings and then they\u2019ll point to examples of how violent Muslims have been throughout history, and then typically they will\xa0 wind up by quoting those \u201clove your enemies\u201d and \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d verses from Jesus to prove how peaceful Christianity is in comparison to Islam.\nWhere do I even begin?\nJesus Was A Nonviolent Messiah\nFirst of all, Jesus was a peaceful Messiah, so much so that they even called Him the \u201cPrince of Peace\u201d [Isaiah 9:6]\nOld Testament prophecies about Jesus promise that He would \u201cdo no violence\u201d [Isaiah 53:9]\n\n\nIsaiah also says that those who \u201cwalk in his path\u201d as He \u201cteaches his ways\u201d to them will \u201clearn to study war no more\u201d and \u201cbeat their swords into plougshares\u201d [Isaiah 2:3-4]\nWhen Jesus was born God sent thousands of angels to shout: \u201cPeace on Earth! Peace and goodwill to all mankind!\u201d [Luke 2:14]\nThe Messiah, who came as a tiny baby rather than a mighty warrior, grew up to teach things like:\n\u201cLove your enemies,\xa0do good to those who hate you,\xa0bless those who curse you,\xa0pray for those who abuse you.\xa0To one who\xa0strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also.\u201d [Luke 6:27-29]\n\n\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the children of God.\u201d [Matt. 5:9]\n\n\u201cMy Kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my disciples would fight.\u201d [John 18:36]\nHe also rebuked His own disciples for wanting to rain down fire on their enemies saying:\xa0\u201cYou know not what Spirit you are of.\xa0For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men\u2019s lives but to save\xa0them.\u201d [Luke 9:55-56]\n\n\nHe wept over Jerusalem because they \u201cdid not know the things that make for peace.\u201d [Luke 19:41]\nJesus also disarmed Peter saying: \u201cPut away your weapon! For those who live by the sword will die by the sword.\u201d [Matt. 26:52]\nWho could forget that Jesus also forgave those who were pounding nails into his hands and feet saying: \u201cFather, forgive them. They know not what they do!\u201d [Luke 23:34]\nSo, it\u2019s really hard to claim that Jesus wasn\u2019t huge on Peace.\n\nBut, what about the \u201cgo and buy a sword\u201d command? What about turning over those tables in the Temple? What about His violent Second Coming? [I\u2019ve dealt with all of those many, many times before].\nIslam Is A Peaceful Religion\n\n\nStill, those same Christians who cock their pistols and polish their shotguns claiming Jesus was pro-gun will turn right around and argue with me that Christianity is a religion of peace as they wet their pants over the \u201cviolence of Islam.\u201d\nUsually, the disagreement begins after one of them shares a meme that compares the violent texts of the Quran with the peace-loving texts of Christianity. As if to say: \u201cSee? Islam\u2019s Holy Book is violent while ours is all about Peace!\u201d\nYet, this is not only inaccurate, it is outright cherry-picking. In fact, one could very easily turn the tables by posting something like this:\n\nFrom there I usually try to point out that our own Bible [especially the Old Testament] has just as many \u2013 if not more \u2013 violent passages that have our God commanding genocide, infanticide and even condoning rape.\n\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll try to remind them that Christians [or at least, people claiming to follow Christianity] have done all sorts of horrific and violent things throughout history, starting pretty much right after Constantine wedded the Church with Empire and leading right up to our current events.\n\n\nPeople don\u2019t like to be reminded how several of America\u2019s recent mass shootings have been committed by professing Christians.\xa0\xa0They also don\u2019t like being reminded that the majority of mass shootings in recent years have been home-grown Americans and mostly white males.\nFurthermore, most American Christians can\u2019t see how it looks to people in Muslim countries when America [a self-professed \u201cChristian Nation\u201d] bombs civilians, kills the innocent and creates more suffering than any terrorist could ever dream of. Those Muslims look at what the American military does as an example of what Christianity is like. So, to them, Christianity is far from a \u201cPeaceful Religion\u201d, it is the most violent, bloody and ruthless religion on the planet.\n\n\nOf course, those who are the most fearful of Muslims and the most critical of Islam have never actually met anyone who is Muslim or tried sitting down to get to know someone who follows Islam. They\u2019ve simply bought into the Tribalistic mindset that says that \u201call Muslims are violent\u201d and \u201call Muslims hate our freedoms\u201d and other nonsensical gibberish which paints everyone in a single category as universally guilty of every crime ever done in its\u2019 name.\nInvite a Muslim family over for dinner and listen to them tell stories about their life, their families, their hopes and dreams, and you\u2019ll never again be able to say \u2013 or to think \u2013 \u201cAll Muslims are violent\u201d because you\u2019ll know at least a few who are certainly not violent. In fact, you might even come to see that they love their children they way you love your children and want the same things out of life as you do.\nSure, in these cases you could point to several verses in the Koran where Muslims are told that\xa0Allah hates violence, or\xa0point to the millions of peace-loving followers of Mohammed around the globe as\xa0evidence of their nonviolent\xa0practice of faith.\n\n\nYou could even show them the \u201cAshtiname of Mohammed\u201d which is a document penned by the Prophet himself in which he commands his followers to offer protection to Christians and to keep them from harm.\nBut, sometimes I\u2019ll simply try to point out that Christians and Muslims have a lot in common. Mainly, the person of Jesus.\nYes, Jesus.\nMost Christians are unaware that the Quran says that:\n\u2013 Jesus is the \u201cWord of God\u201d\n\u2013 Jesus is the \u201cSpirit of God\u201d\n\u2013 Jesus is \u201cthe Messiah\u201d\n\u2013 Jesus creates life\n\u2013 Jesus cured a man born blind, and a man with leprosy.\n\u2013 Jesus gives life to dead people.\n\u2013 Jesus went to heaven.\n\u2013 Jesus is still alive today.\n\u2013 Jesus will come again to judge the entire world.\n[See chapter 3, verses 45-55, the Quran]\nCan you imagine any Christian rejecting another person who had these beliefs as part of their faith?\nNow, I get it: Some people who claim to be Muslims do violent things. But so do some people who claim to be Christians. You don\u2019t want to be compared to a member of the KKK or another Christian White Supremacy group,\xa0do you? So, please treat others the way you want to be treated and don\u2019t compare all Muslims to ISIS or Al Qaeda.\n\n\nStill, this merry-go-round continues to spin on a daily basis. American Christians seem convinced of two mutually-exclusive ideas: One, that their Jesus was absolutely not nonviolent and Two, that their religion is a peaceful religion.\nI believe they call this \u201cCognitive Dissonance\u201d, but to me, it\u2019s just a huge disappointment.\nHopefully, one day, Christians in America will finally receive their Prince of Peace and start being members of the peaceful religion they already believe they\u2019re in.\nUntil that day, I\u2019ll be over here trying to help Christians see that they really do have a nonviolent Messiah who still asks them: \u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord, Lord\u2019 and do not do what I say?\u201d\n**\n\xa0Keith Giles is the author of the Amazon Best-Seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and he also co-hosts the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.

183,PAUL: Apostle of Peace,"February 24, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nWhen we first meet Paul, he\u2019s described as a zealous Pharisee who is \u201cbreathing out murderous threats against the disciples of Christ.\u201d [Acts 9:1]\nLater on, Paul describes himself as someone who \u201cpersecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it.\u201d [Gal. 1:13]\nBut somehow this formerly violent man who stood by and watched the mob stone Stephen to death, and held their coats while they did so, became an Apostle of Christ who boldly preached \u201cthe Gospel of peace.\u201d [Eph. 6:15]\n\n\nSo, what happened?\n\xa0\nImage: Pixabay\nPaul says that what changed him was an encounter with Jesus.\nAfter that day on the road to Damascus when Jesus appeared to him and knocked him, literally off of his ass, Paul went from being a man of violence to an apostle of peace.\nNot only did he simply stop doing violence to Christians, he also went even further to urge Christians to continue to show love and mercy to those who want to kill them.\nFor example, in Romans 12:14-21 Paul says that those who follow Jesus should:\n\u201cBless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them\u2026Repay no one evil for evil, but\xa0give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. \xa0If possible, so far as it depends on you,\xa0live peaceably with all.\xa0Beloved,\xa0never avenge yourselves, but leave it\xa0to the wrath of God\u2026To the contrary,\xa0\u201cif your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.\u201d\xa0Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\u201d\n\n\nAll of this sounds an awful lot like Jesus\u2019s message from the Sermon on the Mount where he told his disciples to:\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Love your enemies and\xa0pray for those who persecute you,\xa0so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and\xa0sends rain on the just and on the unjust.\xa0For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?\xa0And if you greet only your brothers,\xa0what more are you doing than others? Do not even\xa0the Gentiles do the same?\xa0You therefore must be\xa0perfect,\xa0as your heavenly Father is perfect.\u201d [Matt. 5:43-48]\nKeep in mind, Paul himself was already a recipient of this Christ-like mercy. As one who went around knocking on doors and arresting Christians so they could be tortured, jailed and killed, none of the Christians ever tried to kill him in retaliation. If they had, Paul would have never had a chance to meet Jesus, be transformed into an apostle of peace and write most of our New Testament.\nSo, Paul understood this nonviolent, enemy-loving Gospel of Jesus because he was not only the beneficiary of it, he was also a first-hand witness to it. Plus, Paul was experiencing the transformation of his own violent heart, which had once been filled with murder, into a Christ-like heart that was now being filled with the love of God.\n\n\nThe ironic thing today is that many American Christians appear mostly oblivious to this nonviolent enemy-loving component of the Gospel of Christ. Somehow even those \u201cPauline\u201d Christians who prefer the cerebral orthodoxy of Paul to the tangible orthopraxy of Christ\u2019s Sermon on the Mount have still managed to avoid noticing how often Paul repeats and affirms the nonviolent message of Jesus.\nPerhaps they still need to have someone pray over them so that those scales can fall from their eyes? Maybe then they could see that both Jesus and Paul were in complete agreement about not responding to violence with more violence but overcoming evil with love.\nUntil that day, I\u2019ll keep trying to remind everyone that Jesus, the Prince of Peace, invites us to follow his path of nonviolent enemy love where it leads us to beat our swords into plowshares and study war no more.\nPeace,\nKeith\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.

185,Paul\u2019s Nonviolent Authority,"February 22, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nI recently received an advance copy of a scholarly paper written by my friend Dr. Scott Bartchy which deals with Paul\u2019s statement in 1 Cor. 4:21 where he says:\n\u201cWhat would you prefer? Am I to come to you with a stick, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?\u201d\n\n\nThe context of this statement is that Paul\u2019s authority among the Corinthian Christians was being challenged, and Paul certainly felt that his grip on these people was slipping away as some of them began to follow other teachers.\nBartchy\u2019s interest here is in the phrase \u201cAm I to come to you with a stick..?\u201d\nWhy? Because he\u2019s curious what sort of \u201cstick\u201d Paul may have had when it came to exercising authority over the ekklesia.\nAs he points out, in a former life Paul [Saul] certainly knew what it was to carry the stick. He was once empowered by the Jewish authorities to knock down doors, arrest men and women, and even threaten them with death for blasphemy [as we see with the stoning of Stephen where he was an eye-witness to that event].\nSo, we know that Paul was well-acquainted with the power of a stick to motivate people by fear and even by harsh rebuke. However, Paul has gone to great lengths to distance himself from that former frame of mind, even to the changing of his own name, as an indication of just how completely he has become a new person in Christ.\n\n\nBartchy quotes from Kathy Ehrensperger\u2019s book, \u201cPaul and the Dynamics of Power\u201d to support his contention that Paul did not seek to maintain power over his disciples, pointing out that Paul \u201conly has authority in relation to them in as much as he is building them up.\u201d\nEhrensperger also argues [per Bartchy] that Paul \u201cdid not aim or claim at establishing a position of domination or control,\u201d and notes that Paul \u201crepeatedly left behind the house churches he had founded. While later keeping in touch with many of them through letters and colleagues, he pushed on to the West.\u201d (See Romans 15:14-29) and separated himself from his converts in the hope of their continuing empowerment by God\u2019s Spirit in Christ.\u201d [pg. 199]\nBartchy continues: \u201cWhat hold do we imagine that Paul had on his converts, such that his disapproval, however, expressed, could make a serious difference in their lives? What price could he make any of his converts pay for not obeying him? What do we suppose Paul could have done, if indeed he had come to the Corinthian converts \u2018with a stick\u2019\u201d\nThis is the focus of the paper, and a fascinating question to ask. One that I have hardly heard anyone ever pose before, to be honest.\n\n\nLater, in the second epistle to the Corinthians, Paul even warns them that he will \u201cnot be lenient\u201d when he comes to them again (2 Cor. 13:1-4) and that he hopes he \u201cwill not have to be severe in using the authority\u201d that the Lord has given him (v. 10).\nBut, Bartchy wonders, what exactly did Paul have in mind here? What would they have expected this to mean? Would Paul shout at them, or single people out to be banished, or would he just come to them with a bad attitude?\nWell, we do see that Paul made a point to say that he did not want to shame anyone, (see 1 Cor. 4:14), so that removes a few options from our list, but what did Paul mean to suggest?\nBartchy notes: \u201cWhatever means of punishment Paul thought to use, would he, by his own example, have been inadvertently hindering the transformation of his converts by the Spirit? If he came to them with a stick, even in view of the harshness and thrashings for which [teachers] could be known\u2026would not such a negative example of interpersonal relationships have placed an unintended but significant barrier between his converts and his own goal of changing both their convictions and their behavior?\u201d\n\n\nWhat became apparent to me as I considered Bartchy\u2019s questions was that Paul\u2019s authority over these Christians in Corinth was quite obviously very loose. In other words, the very fact that the Corinthian Christians challenged Paul\u2019s authority over them testifies to their freedom. They did not feel the \u201cwrath of Paul\u201d might come down on them for listening to other teachers. In fact, Paul\u2019s \u201cstickless\u201d authority over them is, in itself, partially why they could entertain other ideas without feeling the need to run everything by Paul first.\nBartchy correctly notes that, when it comes to authority in the new testament, \u201cit does not exist until it is granted by those who willingly give that power over them [to others]. While power can coerce, authority results from gained assent.\u201d\nMy friend Jon Zens has phrased it as: \u201cAuthority is something you grant, not something you demand.\u201d\nSo, the authority that Paul has is only that which has been granted to him by the people in the Body of Christ. In the beginning, they freely granted Paul authority to teach and to care for their spiritual health. Now, for some reason or the other, Paul feels that this authority may have been revoked, or perhaps even stolen, by other teachers.\n\n\n \n\nBartchy\u2019s main thesis is that Paul would not likely come to them \u201cwith a stick\u201d because to do so might play into their expectations of authority [as they might have been used to in their own previous experiences with so-called \u201cleaders\u201d]. Instead, Bartchy argues, Paul would have taken another approach \u2013 a \u201ccruciform\u201d authority.\nAs he notes: \u201cPaul must have known that the key to his success in this regard was his own Christ-like, Spirit-filled behavior. As one who had been raised according to the dominant values and social codes in ancient Mediterranean culture, Paul must also have known that he had undertaken a super-human task as he sought to lead the Corinthians into a less arrogant, less competitive, less envy-filled way of acting.\u201d\nJust before the \u201cstick\u201d reference, Bartchy notes that Paul said: \u201cWhen reviled, we bless. When persecuted, we endure. When slandered, we speak kindly.\u201d [1 Cor. 4:12-13]\n\u201cSuch counterintuitive responses make clear that Paul himself as a Christ-follower had been undergoing a very serious, Spirit-led re-socialization process, in sharp contrast to the values by which his parents and other significant adults had raised him.\u201d\n\n\nThen? Paul urges his converts to follow his own example and to imitate his Christ-like character. [See 1 Cor. 11:1]\nSo, why even mention the possibility of coming to them with a stick at all?\nBartchy suggests that Paul did this \u201c\u2026to stress in sharp contrast the alternative values that he had consistently lived by when he was among them\u2026Was he assuming that some of them would really have preferred him to act \u2018the old-fashioned way\u2019 and thus ironically reminding them that he really did not have a stick anymore?\u201d\nPaul has already stressed his lack of power by saying: \u201cWe are fools for Christ\u2019s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak but you are strong. You are held in honor but we are in disrepute.\u201d [1 Cor. 4:10]\nBartchy says: \u201cPaul\u2019s stress in this passage is on his refusal to retaliate and use power for himself is unambiguously the behavioral context in which Paul urges his converts to imitate him\u2026\u2019not seeking his own advantage but that of many\u2019.\u201d\nInterestingly, Paul does not play the \u201cSpiritual Father\u201d card. We know that he easily could have, but he does not.\n\n\nIn 1 Cor. 4:15 Paul reminds them that \u201cthey did not have many fathers [pateras]\u201d in Christ and that \u201cindeed, in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the gospel.\u201d\nYet, the word often rendered as \u201cFather\u201d in our English translations betrays the reality of what Paul is saying here. He does not use the term \u201cfather\u201d (Pater) in this sentence. Rather, what Paul wrote was \u201cin Christ Jesus through the gospel I begot you\u201d (egennesa).\nBy using this term, Paul carefully avoids claiming the title of \u201cFather\u201d (Pater) for himself. He also avoids the use in the letter to Philemon but again used the term \u201cegennesa\u201d instead to suggest that Paul wanted only to emphasize the nurturing caretaker side rather than the authoritative position of dominance typically associated with the term \u201cPater\u201d.\nIf Paul had wanted to leverage the \u201cFatherly\u201d aspect of his relationship with them, as one with an inherent authority over them, he could easily have done so by using the word \u201cPater\u201d, yet he carefully avoids it and simply says that he has cared for them like a loving father-figure whose only authority would be granted in love by a child who reciprocated and appreciated that loving care.\n\n\nAs Bartchy notes: \u201cWhat Paul did not do is claim \u2018because I am your father you must obey me!\u2019 In that sense, Paul never played his culture\u2019s well-known \u2018father card.\u2019\u201d\nIf anything, Paul appeals more to a motherly metaphor by comparing himself to a nursing mother [1 Cor. 3.2] and in other epistles used similar motherly images to refer to himself [see 1 Thess. 2:7; Gal. 4:19-20]\nThis comparison with a maternal figure automatically defers any and all paternal authority that Paul might have claimed for himself, and this is most obviously by design.\nBartchy closes his paper by saying: \u201cNo matter how weak his opponents perceived him to be, Paul knew that his strength was based on acting with agape love \u2018in a spirit of gentleness.\u2019 Paul at his best, according to his own transformed values, was indeed \u2018stickless\u2019 in Corinth.\u201d\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and the co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.

187,Agape Against The Machine,"February 18, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nOver the weekend I watched a live concert DVD from a band called \u201cRage Against the Machine\u201d.\nTheir message and their attitude \u2013 as one might expect \u2013 is not only rage, but more specifically \u201coutrage\u201d at the injustices of our society and the crimes of our government against the innocent people of this nation, and also against people in other nations.\n\n\nSo, they crank up their guitars and they pound on their drums and they shout and scream against this injustice.\nBut as I watched this concert and listened to them make their case, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the futility of all this rage.\nI mean, if all you have is anger and rage, what good does that do you? What good does it do for those people who have been exploited? In what way does it make anything better or change anything for the good?\nWell, I had to confess, it doesn\u2019t do any good at all.\nPerhaps it is the overwhelming sense of futility and powerlessness that fuels this rage in the first place?\nBut what else can be done, really?\nWe see the injustice. We want to do something about it. But we realize we have no real power to make it stop. So, all we have left to do is to just rage about it.\nBut, is that really all we can do?\nWhat if, instead of raging against the machine we tried to love against the machine?\n\n\nIsn\u2019t this what Jesus had in mind?\nHe showed up and essentially said, \u201cYou\u2019ve made a mess of your life. Your leaders have made a mess of this world. If you\u2019re ready to try something new \u2013 to repent of all of the \u201ceye for an eye\u201d escalation of violence \u2013 here\u2019s another way to live: Love your enemies.\u201d\nThis is the kind of love Jesus is talking about: Unconditional, irrational, exceptional love beyond explanation. The Greek for that kind of love is \u201cAgape\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a preemptive love \u2013 a proactive agape \u2013 that demonstrates love to others simply because, without any strings attached.\nYou see, Jesus knows that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.\nJesus wants us to admit that a mindless continuation of \u201cyou hurt me, so I\u2019ll hurt you\u201d methodology will get us \u2013 and has never gotten us \u2013 anywhere but here.\nIn other words, if someone doesn\u2019t break the \u201ceye for an eye\u201d chain early on, we\u2019ll all eventually end up blinded.\n\n\nSo, Jesus says, \u201cFollow me!\u201d\nFollowing Jesus means loving our enemies, blessing those who curse us, praying for those who mistreat us, and disarming their hate with His agape love.\nI know, it seems so powerless, doesn\u2019t it? I mean, how could love and mercy and forgiveness and compassion ever make a difference?\nJesus said it was like a small mustard seed, or a little bit of yeast. He said this love of God \u2013 which seems so small and weak \u2013 is secretly revealed to be an unstoppable source of transformational energy capable of changing us, and everyone around us, from the inside out.\nYes, the world is a dark place. Yes, the powers of greed, war, hate and lust seem so far beyond our means to stop.\nBut we know something they don\u2019t know:\xa0We know that the power of weakness is actually the power of Christ at work within us.\nWe know that even the smallest flame cannot be snuffed out by all the darkness in the universe.\nWe know that even the tiniest seed can grow into a massive weed that overtakes the entire garden and spreads like wildfire across the continents.\n\n\n \n\nWe know that even the tiniest baby can melt the hardest heart.\nLet me ask: \u201cHow could you ever defeat an enemy who only gained strength as he got weaker?\u201d\nAnswer: \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\nThis is what Paul wants us to understand when he talks about the \u201cpower of weakness\u201d which is impossible to overcome.\xa0[See 2 Cor. 12]\nThis means that we, in our weakness, are carriers of the unlimited power of Christ.\nHow do we unleash this power? By doing what He did \u2013 \xa0We let go of our own identity and status and rights and lay down everything, even unto death (see Philippians 2:5-10).\nWhen we do this, the power of Christ flows through us like super-charged thermonuclear energy.\nOur response of love is more critical than we might think.\nThis, I believe, is what Paul the Apostle has in mind in Romans chapter 12. First, he appeals to the unspeakable glory of God (at the end of chapter 11) and urges us to present our bodies as living sacrifices to God. Then he tells us not to be conformed to the pattern of this world, but to be transformed.\n\n\nBut why?\nSo that we can love others (v.9-10), and so that we can bless those who persecute us (v.14), repay the evil with blessings (v.17), live at peace with all men (v.18), refrain from vengeance (v.19), feed our enemies (v.20) and, eventually, even overcome evil with good (v.21).\nDo you see what Paul suggests? He\u2019s saying that once we are transformed we need to live transformed lives.\nWhy? So that our lives can un-make this world of darkness and unleash the resurrection power of Christ.\n\xa0This is why we turn the other cheek. This is why we pray for those who hate us. This is why we are called peacemakers.\nNot to be doormats, but to be warriors of the transformation.\nWe are each like little a virus that transforms an organism from the inside out.\nJesus has a plan to re-make the world, and this process is already in motion.\n\xa0\u201cAnd\xa0he who was seated on the throne said, \u201cBehold, I\xa0am making all things new.\u201d Also he said, \u201cWrite this down, for\xa0these words are trustworthy and true.\u201d [Rev. 21:5]\n\n\nThat includes you and me.\nIt also includes the powers of darkness.\nOne day, and it may be very soon, the kingdoms of this world will crumble and fall.\nOne day, the Kingdom of our God will overtake all other kingdoms.\nEvery knee will bow.\nEvery tongue will confess.\n\u201cJesus is Lord.\u201d\nSo, whenever you see injustice, even it makes you feel like raging, take a moment and remember to love against the machine.\nThis is the only power we have to change anything.\n\u201cLove never fails.\u201d \u2013 1 Cor. 13\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

188,"Cold, Dead Hands","February 16, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nAmerica has a gun problem. But America doesn\u2019t know it has a gun problem.\n\nThe research confirms it. Every 60 hours Americans are victims of a mass shooting. We are 10 times more likely to die from gun violence than people in other nations.\n\n\nOther countries have successfully reversed gun violence, but we seem unable to do so.\nMore \u201cunwilling\u201d than unable, to be honest.\nOur problem is rooted in our DNA. We have a \u201cRight to bear arms\u201d. This means that any threat to our rights is Unamerican, and therefore a threat to Liberty and Freedom.\nIf we saw gun ownership as more of a responsibility or as a privilege, instead of a right, then maybe we might take a different approach to our current problem.\nI recently posted this image on my Facebook wall.\n\nMostly as a thought experiment; to help people see that there is a problem and that to solve it we\xa0just might have to decide which we love more \u2013 our kids or our guns.\nMy dilemma is this: I do not believe in politics to solve our problems. I wrote a book about the evils of being entangled with politics. I was once a member of the NRA. I voted \u201cStraight Ticket\u201d Republican my entire life. I used to believe that it was impossible to be a real Christian without voting Conservative.\n\n\nBut now I\u2019ve realized that the whole thing \u2013 Left, Right and in the Middle \u2013 is a joke and an empty promise.\nStill, we cannot solve our problem if we don\u2019t admit we have one. So, my hope is to at least help people to see that we do have a problem with guns, and once we confess this as a nation, then maybe we can talk about how to fix it.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heart issue!\u201d Yes, but if it is only a heart issue, then American hearts are the most murderous and violent on earth. And if so, then maybe people with hearts like ours shouldn\u2019t have free and easy access to assault weapons designed to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mental health issue!\u201d Maybe, but if so then can we at least agree that it would be better to provide more care, counseling, and other services to these people rather than make it easier for them to purchase deadly weapons? This increase in mental health care would also significantly help our homeless epidemic too, by the way.\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing into the Liberal Agenda!\u201d If so, I can assure you it is not by design. But if a Samaritan comes to clean my wounds and pulls me out of the ditch, do I really care if he is a Samaritan, or a Liberal, or a Republican? It\u2019s Tribalism like this that is killing us. We are blind to our own humanity. We only see Red or Blue people, not humans like us who love their children the same way we love our own children.\n\n\nThis Tribalism is so bad that Pastors on a Sunday morning cannot preach the words of Jesus from the Sermon on the Mount without their congregations bristling when Jesus says \u201cLove your enemies\u201d or \u201cCare for the poor\u201d because that\u2019s just \u201cLiberal talk\u201d.\nAmerican Christians seem to view everything through their political lens. If only we could see through the lens of Jesus, then maybe the veil would be taken away. [2 Cor. 3:14]\nBut I do see a glimmer of hope for the future.\nOur children are largely immune to this Tribalism. They don\u2019t care about Hillary or Trump. They are tired of seeing their friends shot and killed in the classroom, or the nightclub, or the concert. They are tired of watching as their parents do nothing because they are paralyzed by their politics.\nOne day our children will grow up. They will take the baton out of our cold, dead hands and they will finally do what we cannot \u2013 and will not do.\nI pray that day comes soon.\nThe Spirit and the Bride say: \u201cCome quickly!\u201d\nAmen.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

189,How To Transform Culture Without Becoming Entangled In Politics,"February 16, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nHonestly, this is a very challenging topic for me. Not only to write about, but more so to walk out in a practical way.\nHere\u2019s why: Because quite often people will mistake engaging the culture with being political.\n\nFor example, systemic racism is a pervasive reality in America. For many, this is seen as a political issue and not a moral issue. Therefore, if I write about the evils of racism, or if I point out the injustices suffered by people of color in this nation, I am often accused of being political.\n\n\nBut justice and politics are not the same things.\nJustice is about pointing out what is wrong [injustice] and working to make it right again.\nSo, feeding the hungry, caring for the outcast, standing alongside the LGBTQ community, speaking out against exploitation, crying out for an end to gun violence, and shining a light on racial inequality isn\u2019t about politics \u2013 it\u2019s about justice.\nPolitics is about choosing sides, advocating for laws to be passed or struck down, aligning with a particular ideology and standing for a certain platform.\nThose who follow Christ cannot ignore issues of justice. We cannot turn a blind eye to suffering. We cannot allow people who are made in the image of God to be marginalized and exploited, especially if there is something we can do about it.\nBut, this is where the question arises: What can we do about it?\nFor some, a political solution makes the most sense. They rally around a particular party or politician hoping to bring about justice in that way.\n\n\nFor others, they are convinced that politics isn\u2019t the best way to transform a culture or influence society. Instead of pursuing the political path, these people might instead seek to bring about a change at the grassroots level. This is often the slower approach to change, but in the long run, it is the most enduring one.\nIn the meantime, there are those from both sides who take the time to care for the broken, comfort the oppressed, and feed the hungry. This is how we should respond to the immediate needs of people who suffer injustice, long before we take the justice path or the political option if we hope to alleviate the pain.\nSo, for someone like me who has abandoned the political option. It can sometimes be challenging to walk the line, so to speak, on issues of injustice.\nThere is still a need to critique the culture and to point out the contrasts between the glorious Kingdom of God and the pathetic kingdoms of the world.\nFor some, these critiques are interpreted as being political. And in some cases, they may be right about that. But as long as we can critique the culture without taking sides, and without becoming nationalistic in the process, this critique is still valid.\n\n\nWhy? Because our main goal is to transform the culture from the inside out. One of the ways we do that is to point out how Jesus\u2019 Kingdom is better and how He has a better plan to transform the world with preemptive love and proactive agape.\nMany Christians take this too far, in my estimation. They not only want to speak out against injustice and point out the better way of Jesus, but they continue on to seek out political power and influence of their own. This, to me, is a mistake.\n\n\nWhy? Because the best way to change the world is through the Gospel, not through political influence.\nDid the early church impact their culture? Yes, they most certainly did.\nDid they do so by infiltrating the Roman government or political process? No, they did not.\nAnd let\u2019s keep in mind that they most certainly could have done so if that was their intention. There are numerous examples of Roman officials and civil magistrates who came to faith in Christ in the early church.\nInstead of seeking to install Christians at the highest levels of power, they required every one of those new converts to resign their positions of authority in the Roman government and renounce political entanglements.\n\n\n\xa0\u201cA military commander or civic magistrate must resign or be rejected. If a believer seeks to become a soldier, he must be rejected, for he has despised God.\u201d\xa0(Hippolytus of Rome)\nRemember:\xa0Their own brothers and sisters in the Body of Christ were being arrested and put to death during this time. How tempting must it have been for them to leverage their political influence to set those people free and to end the persecution of their faith?\nStill, they remained true to their Lord\u2019s example and refused the temptation to entangle their faith with politics. They were willing to obey Jesus and remain loyal to His Kingdom even to the death.\nWhat\u2019s more, they didn\u2019t wait for the government to change the world. They got busy changing it themselves with the best weapon possible: The Gospel of Jesus.\nThe Gospel that had transformed their lives from the inside out was more than powerful enough to transform their neighbors, and their community, and yes, even their empire \u2013 one person at a time.\n\n\nUntangling ourselves from politics doesn\u2019t mean that we unplug ourselves from the culture around us. Far from it.\nIf anything, we must become more engaged with the culture \u2013 and more acquainted with those who are suffering at the hands of the Empire \u2013 so that we can administer the love of Christ and spread the virus of His Kingdom to those who are broken under the crushing weight of injustice.\nWe cannot transform the world by disengaging from the culture. Being salt and light involves getting our hands dirty. We must step into the fight. We must carry our cross and suffer alongside those who are suffering.\nAs my friend Jackie Pullinger once said, \u201cThe Gospel is always life for those who receive it and death for those who bring it.\u201d\nOur lives belong to the King. Let\u2019s walk in the power of His resurrection and bring life and light to those who are in darkness.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He is also the co-host of \u201cThe Heretic Happy Hour\u201d Podcast.\n\n\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/02/transform-culture-without-becoming-entangled-politics/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
190,Worm-Free Christianity,"February 14, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nThere are no worms in the Body of Christ.\nOur favorite hymns might suggest otherwise, but once we come to Jesus we begin to become new creatures who are partakers of the Divine nature.\nEveryone who abides in Christ is a brand new creature. We are not \u201cworms\u201d or \u201cwretches\u201d who are in need of God\u2019s constant pity or objects of disgust.\n\n\n\nYes, before the cross perhaps we were most pitiful and dead in our sins.\nBefore we knew Jesus perhaps we were in some senses broken or without hope or blind.\nBut praise God we are no longer in this condition!\nThose who are in Christ are not regarded as worms, but as sons and daughters of God.\nWe who are members of the Body of Christ are loved and treasured. We are not miserable wretches covered in our filthy sins.\nIs that hard to accept? If so, maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019ve grown up hearing this garbage about yourself reinforced over and over again.\nMaybe there were some Christians in your church experience who poured shame over you.\nMaybe there were pastors and teachers who preached messages of condemnation to keep you under control.\nMaybe there were some worship leaders who planted melodies in your heart that emphasized your\xa0previous experience as a worm and a wretch.\nBut that\u2019s not who Jesus says you are.\n\n\nWe are sons and daughters.\nWe are filled with the fullness of Christ.\nWe are new creatures with a new nature.\nWe are holy.\nWe are spotless.\nWe are dearly loved.\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, look it up. The New Testament is chock full of truth about our new identity in Christ.\nJesus affirms our worth.\nJesus declares our freedom.\nJesus proclaims that we are friends, not slaves.\nJesus reminds us that we are God\u2019s children who cry out \u201cAbba!\u201d to our Heavenly Father who loves us dearly.\nJesus says that He and the Father will come and make their home with those who love and obey Him.\nAre you in Christ? Then there is no condemnation for you. None at all.\nAre you in Christ? Then there is nothing in the entire Universe with the power to separate you from the love of God.\n\n\nAre you in Christ? Then you are forever knitted together with Jesus for the rest of eternity.\nRepeat after me: \u201cI am not a worm. I am a dearly loved child of God. Jesus lives and breathes in me right now. He will never leave me. He will never forsake me. His love for me will never die.\u201d\nNow, set your eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith. Place your hope in Him, the One who loves you beyond measure.\nStart living every day, moment by moment, in the new reality of your identity in Christ.\nIf you can, try helping others to see that they are not worms, either.\nWe all need a lot more worm-free Christianity.\nNeed a reminder of how God really sees you?\nThis is the truth about who you are:\nI AM ACCEPTED\nI am God\u2019s child [John\xa0 1:12]\nI am Jesus\u2019s friend [John 15:15]\nI am justified.

191,The 7 Signs of Josephus Reveal End Times Destruction,"February 9, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nOur only first-hand account of the Roman assault on the Temple comes from the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius who was a former leader of the Jewish Revolt who had surrendered to the Romans and had won favor from Vespasian. In gratitude, Josephus took on Vespasian\u2019s family name \u2013 Flavius \u2013 as his own.\nAs an eyewitness to the destruction of Jerusalem, Josephus gives us a startling window into a series of seven signs which God sent to the people of Jerusalem prior to their ultimate destruction in AD 70.\n\n\n\nThe Seven Signs of Josephus\nJosephus prefaces these signs by saying in his book \u201cThe Jewish War\u201c:\n\u201cThus it was that the wretched people were deluded at that time by charlatans and pretended messengers of the deity; while they neither heeded nor believed in the manifest portents that foretold the coming desolation, but, as if thunderstruck and bereft of eyes and mind, disregarded the plain warnings of God.\u201d\n1) A SWORD IN THE SKY\n\u201cSo it was when a star resembling a sword, stood over the city[Jerusalem] and a comet which continued for a year.\u201d [In 66 AD]\nKeep in mind what the shape of a sword is and how closely a sword appears to a cross. If swords and crosses are similarly shaped, then perhaps this statement by Jesus in the Olivet Discourse was fulfilled by the sign of the sword in the sky:\n\u201cThen will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth\xa0will mourn\xa0when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven,\xa0with power and great glory.\u201d (Matt. 24:30)\n\n\nThe \u201cSon of Man coming on the clouds of heaven\u201d is a reference to the judgment of Jerusalem which was physically manifested in the Roman Army which surrounded the city and destroyed it.\n2) A BRIGHT LIGHT\n\u201cSo again when, before the revolt and the commotion that led to war [i.e., before the war], at the time when the people were assembling for the feast of unleavened bread, on the eighth of the month Xanthieus [Nisan], at the ninth hour of the night [3 a.m.] \u2026 \u2026 so brilliant a light shown round the [holy] altar and the sanctuary[of the temple] that it seemed to be broad daylight; and this continued for half an hour. By the inexperienced, this was regarded as a good omen, but by the sacred scribes it was at once interpreted in accordance with after[later] events.\u201d\n3) A COW GIVES BIRTH TO A LAMB\n\u201cAt that same feast [just after the 2nd sign, the great light over the altar] a cow that had been brought by someone for sacrifice gave birth [just before it was to be killed] to a lamb in the midst in the court of the Temple.\u201d\n4) THE EASTERN GATE OPENS BY ITSELF\n\u201cThe eastern gate of the inner court \u2014 it was of brass and very massive, and, when closed towards evening, could scarcely be moved by 20 men; fastened with iron-bound bars [on each side], it had bolts which were sunk to a great depth into a threshold consisting of a solid block of stone \u2014 this gate was observed at the sixth hour of the night [midnight] to have opened of its own accord. The watchmen of the temple ran and reported the matter to the captain, and he came up and with difficulty succeeded in shutting it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis again to the uninitiated seemed the best of omens, as they supposed that God had opened to them the gate of blessings.\u201d \u201cBut the learned understood that the security of the Temple was dissolving of its own accord and that the opening of the gate meant a present to the enemy, interpreting the portent [sign, the same word as in the gospel] in their own minds as indicative of coming desolation.\u201d\n5) ARMIES IN THE SKY\n\u201cAgain, not many days after that festival on the twenty-first of Artemisium [the Jewish month of Iyyar which is in the late springtime], there appeared a miraculous phenomenon, passing belief. Indeed, what I am about to relate would, I imagine, have been deemed a fable, were it not for the narratives of eyewitnesses and for the subsequent calamities which deserved to be so signalized [so \u201csign-ized,\u201d a great sign]. For before sunset \u2026\u201d \u201cFor before sunset throughout all parts of the country [of Judea] chariots were seen in the air and armed battalions hurtling through the clouds and encompassing the cities.\u201d\n6) VOICES SPEAKING\n\u201cMoreover, at the feast which is called Pentecost the priests [all 24 of them] on entering the inner court of the Temple by night as their custom was in the discharge of their ministrations, reported that they were conscious, first of a commotion and a din [a great noise], and after that of a voice as of a host [an army], \u2018We are departing hence [from here].\u201d\n\n\nIs it interesting that on the day of Pente\xadcost exactly 33 years from the time that the Gospel started in Jerusalem \u2014 to the very day \u2014 this announce\xadment and sign occurred.\n7) THE LAST PROPHET: JESUS/JOSHUA\n\u201cBut a further portent was even more alarming. Four years before the war [in Tabernacles time in 62 C.E.] when the city was enjoying profound peace and prosperity, there came to the feast at which it was the custom of all Jews to erect tabernacles to God, one Joshua, [Another way of saying \u201cJesus\u201d or \u201cY\u2019Shua\u201d] son of Ananias, a rude peasant, who, standing in the Temple, suddenly began to cry out, \u2018A voice from the east, a voice from the west,\xa0 a voice from the four winds;\xa0 a voice against Jerusalem and the sanctuary,\xa0 a voice against the bridegroom and the bride,\xa0 a voice against all the people.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cDay and night he went about all the alleys with this cry on his lips. Some of the leading citizens, incensed at these ill-omened words, arrested the fellow and severely chastised him. But he without a word on his own behalf or for the private ear of those who smote him only continued his cries as before.\n\u201cThereupon, the magistrates, supposing, as was indeed the case that the man was under some supernatural impulse, brought him before the Roman governor; there, although flayed to the bone with scourges, he neither sued for mercy nor shed a tear, but, merely introducing the most mournful of variations into his ejaculation [words from his mouth], responded to each stroke with \u2018Woe to Jerusalem!\u2019\n\n\n\u201cWhen Albinus, the [Roman] governor asked him who [he was] and whence he was [where he came from] and why he uttered these cries, he answered him never a word, but unceasingly reiterated his dirge over the city, until Albinus pronounced him a maniac and let him go.\n\u201cDuring the whole period up to the outbreak of the war he neither approached nor was seen talking to any of the citizens, but daily, like a prayer\u2026repeated his lament, \u2018Woe to Jerusalem!\u2019 He neither cursed any of those who beat him from day to day, nor blessed those who offered him food: to all men that melancholy presage was his one reply. His cries were loudest at the festivals.\n\u201cSo for seven years and five months he continued his wail, his voice never flagging nor his strength exhausted, until the siege, having seen his presage verified, he found his rest. For, while going his round and shouting in piercing tones from the wall, \u2018Woe once more to the city and to the people and to the Temple,\u2019 as he added a last word, \u2018and woe to me also,\u2019 a stone hurled from the ballista struck and killed him on the spot. So with those ominous words still on his lips he passed away.\u201d\nHow fascinating! One final \u201cJesus\u201d is sent to the people to pronounce daily, unending \u201cwoe\u201d upon them right up until the armies are actually surrounding the city.\n\n\nROMAN HISTORIAN TACITUS ALSO CONFIRMS:\n\u201cThere were many prodigies presignifying their ruin which was not averted by all the sacrifices and vows of that people. Armies were seen fighting in the air with brandished weapons. A fire fell upon the Temple from the clouds. The doors of the Temple were suddenly opened. At the same time there was a loud voice saying that the gods were removing, which was accompanied with a sound as of a multitude going out. All which things were supposed, by some to portend great calamities.\u201d [Tacitus Historiae V: The Roman Earthworks at Jerusalem]\nNOTE: Titus reportedly refused to accept a wreath of victory, saying that the victory did not come through his own efforts but that he had merely served as an instrument of God\u2019s wrath.[6]\xa0 [Philostratus, The Life of Apollonius of Tyana]\nIt is beyond amazing that Josephus, a non-believing Jewish historian, would record these signs from God that preceded the ultimate destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the Jewish Age. It\u2019s also very significant that the day the Temple was destroyed in AD 70 was the exact same day and month that the previous Jewish Temple was destroyed.\n\n\nThis was no coincidence. This was an emphatic statement that God had brought an end to the outward signs and fulfilled them all in Christ.\nThe Day of the Lord prophesied all throughout the Old Testament Scriptures, and also confirmed by Jesus in the Olivet Discourse, was totally and completely fulfilled in AD 70 when the Roman Army surrounded Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple, ended the animal sacrifice and disbanded the priesthood.\nToday, the followers of Christ are now the new, living Temple of God which is made up of Priests who offer themselves as Living Sacrifices to God.\nWant to read more about the End Times, Prophecy and the Return of Christ?\nShocking News About End Times Prophecy\nThe New Jerusalem Scandal\nWhy I Am Not Waiting For Jesus To Return\nJesus Returns Today\nJesus Never Predicted The End\xa0 Of The World\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of the Amazon Best-Seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and he also co-hosts the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.

193,"Love, Hate and the Kingdom of God","February 7, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\nBelieve it or not, some Christians keep a list of people who can be righteously hated and even put to death, in spite of Jesus\u2019 commands to love our enemies and bless those who hate us.\xa0Usually, those who fall into this exceptional category are criminals, terrorists, enemies of the state, homosexuals, and abortionists.Frankly, many Christians have their own private list of who can be/should be put to death. It might be an ex-spouse, a person who abused them in the past, a drunk driver who took away their loved one, or the umpire who blew the call that ended their team\u2019s chances at a national championship.\n\n\nIt should be obvious to anyone who knows the Gospel of Christ that there are no exemptions when it comes to the commands to love our enemies, bless those who hate us, and do good to those who seek to harm us. None whatsoever.\nThat means God loves all the same people that you really hate. He loves those people you wish were dead. He loves those people that hurt you and ripped you off. He loves everyone in prison, no matter what they did to get there. He loves the people who got away with murder, and the people who helped them get away with it.\nNow, that doesn\u2019t mean that God loves what they did, or what they do. Far from it. In fact, it\u2019s because he \u201cso loved the world\u201d that he sent Jesus in the first place. Because he saw how horrific we all were without His love, and he sent Jesus to show us what it really looks like \u2013 and feels like \u2013 to receive that love. He sent Jesus to transform us through His love, and to rescue us from the penalty of a life without His love.This means that those terrorists you\u2019d like to see burned alive are within reach of God\u2019s grace. Why destroy them before they have an opportunity to know Christ who can transform their hearts?It reminds me of Jesus\u2019 own disciples who asked \u201cShall we call down fire from heaven to destroy them?\u201d in reference to a Samaritan village that refused to have Jesus travel through it on his way to Jerusalem. The response Jesus gave to these disciples is the same as what he would say to Christians today who yearn to rain down destruction on anyone: \u201cYou do not know what kind of Spirit you are of; for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men\u2019s lives, but to save them.\u201d (John 9:54-56)Loving our enemies is hard, of course. Our old nature is quick to crave violence and retribution. But Jesus has given us a new nature and a new spirit.\xa0If we really hope to love our enemies, we have to first admit that we do not have access to this kind of love. This sort of unconditional love is just not in us by nature. The closest we can ever come is the love a parent has for a child. But even that example (as profound as it may be) falls short of the extravagant love that God wants to fill us with.God\u2019s love just \u201cis\u201d. It\u2019s not dependent upon anything the person does or does not do. And that\u2019s why Jesus can tell us that, if we are abiding in Him, and if He is alive in us, then we will be connected to the constant, eternal flow of Divine Love that flows from the heart of the Trinity and outward into every corner of the Universe. We become conduits of His endless love and therefore everyone around us becomes illuminated in the light of His unconditional love.\n\n\nAnd if we are indeed carriers of Christ-like love, then we cannot shoot anyone in the face. We cannot even wish that anyone were dead. We cannot cheer when someone receives the harsh judgment we believe they deserve.\n\n\nEven God doesn\u2019t take pleasure in the death of the wicked:\xa0\n\u201cAs I live, declares the Lord\xa0God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.\u201d (Ezekiel 33:11)\nJesus leaves us no wiggle room here. He loves everyone, and He commands us to love everyone as well.\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019\xa0But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,\xa0so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.\xa0For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?\xa0And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?\xa0You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\u201d (Matt. 5:43-48)\n\n\n\xa0\nThose people you hate? God loves them and He wants you to love them, too.\n\xa0\nTo be a follower of Jesus is to obey His commands. If we struggle with those commands, we must throw ourselves at His feet and beg Him for the grace to love as He loves, forgive as He forgives, and serve others as He serves us.\n\xa0\nLove is our tattoo. Love is our song.

194,That Awkward Moment When Your Christian President Contradicts Jesus,"February 2, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for American Christians who embrace the idea that they live in a \u201cChristian Nation\u201d is how to reconcile the very Un-Christ-like things their Government says and does.\nImage: Elim Feliciano\nNever mind that there is zero trace of anything Jesus ever taught in any of the foundational documents, including the Constitution.\n\n\nNever mind that Jesus already is a King who reigns over His own sovereign nation whose citizens are from every tongue and tribe and nation on Earth.\nNever mind that the Founding Fathers \u2013 even if every one of them had actually been followers of Jesus \u2013 went out of their way to establish a Government that was most assuredly anything but \u201cChristian\u201d but instead made provision for the free practice and reverent observance of every religion, or none at all.\nAll of that aside, those Christians who insist on asserting ever-increasing influence upon the United States Government have a very serious problem: Politicians are lousy examples of Jesus.\nFor example: The man who is currently the President of the United States claims to be a Christian. Just like the President before him, and the one before him, and the other 40 before him.\nHere\u2019s the issue: Presidents of Empires are not submitted to Christ.\nFor that matter, Empires are not submitted to Christ either.\nSo, when the professed \u201cChristian\u201d leader stands up in front of millions of Americans and boldly contradicts Jesus, it should really concern these Christians.\n\n\nFor example, if an American President should stand up and say:\n\u201cAround the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.\u201d\nThis should cause every true follower of Jesus to gasp in horror and disbelief; \u201cDid the President of the United States just contradict Jesus, Paul and the entire New Testament?\u201d\nYes. Yes, he did.\nBut how did most American Christian leaders react to this? Largely by applauding the President, agreeing with him, and celebrating just how \u201cPro-Christian\u201d he is.\n\n\nWait, what? Oh, yes. They did.\nThis is the problem. Most American Christians weren\u2019t even aware that the President had contradicted their Lord and Savior at all.\nWhy? Because most of them don\u2019t take Him very seriously.\nJesus, the guy they claim to follow and worship, actually said that showing weakness is not the \u201csurest path to conflict\u201d but the surest path to peace.\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.\u2019 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.\u201d\n\u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018Love your neighbor\xa0and hate your enemy.\u2019\xa0But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,\xa0that you may be children\xa0of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\xa0If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?\u201d (Matt. 5:38-47)\n\n\nPaul, the Apostle who wrote most of their New Testament scriptures, also loudly affirms the power of weakness, saying:\n\u201cTherefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ\u2019s power may rest on me.\xa0That is why, for Christ\u2019s sake, I delight\xa0in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships,\xa0in persecutions,\xa0in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.\u201d (2 Cor. 12: 9-10)\nThe whole \u201cunmatched power\u201d comment by the sitting President is also very curious in and of itself, since America is already the most powerful military force on the planet, spending more on military defense than the other 7 largest nations combined.\nIf it were actually true that \u201cunmatched power is the surest means of our defense\u201d, as he said in his televised speech, then isn\u2019t this nation already the most well-defended nation on the planet?\nHow much more \u201cunmatched\u201d do we need to be?\nIt also makes the rest of his speech even more insane as he goes on to say:\n\n\n\u201cFor this reason, I am asking the Congress to\u2026\xa0fully fund our great military.\u201d\nIf the United States military spending is already billions more than what other nations spend on defense, then in what way is the US military not \u201cfully funded\u201d?\nKeep in mind that when any US President uses the phrase \u201cour great military\u201d in reference to increased government spending on the military, that is not a reference to the men and women in uniform. Almost none of that \u201cmilitary spending\u201d makes its way to the pockets or bank accounts of actual soldiers.\nNo, what they mean is simply this: Billions more dollars in Government contracts for weapons manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, Northrup-Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, etc.\nThose corporations are not hurting for cash.\n\n\nThey already received billions of dollars to build weapons, many of them the Pentagon specifically admits they do not want, or need. But they build them anyway because Congress funds their contracts.\n\n\nBut I digress.\nThe most offensive statement spoken by the President of the United States, to me at least, was this one:\n\u201cAs part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet.\u201d\nI guess this statement offends me the most because Jesus is the Prince of Peace. If anyone claims to follow Jesus, then they are, by default, saying that they also follow the Prince of Peace.\nNow, could anyone have any better ideas about how to achieve peace than the actual \u201cPrince of Peace\u201d?\nThe truth is: Jesus has already shown us the path to peace, we just refuse to believe Him or walk in it.\nAmerica already has enough nuclear weapons to pulverize the planet twenty times over. Has this strong and powerful nuclear arsenal deterred any acts of aggression?\nNone at all.\n\n\nAmerica is still engaged in warfare all over the world, as it has been for 222 years out of the last 239 years of its existence.\nThis \u201cmagical moment\u201d is spoken of facetiously, not hopefully. There is not even an attempt to pretend to even want such a day to come.\nWhen one says, \u201cwe are not there yet\u201d, I have to ask, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nThe promised Messiah has come. He, as the Old Testament prophet Isaiah promised us, was the One who would \u201cteach us His ways so that we might walk in His paths\u201d. \nAnd where does His path lead us? Well, according to that same prophet, if we follow this Messiah then He will teach us to \u201cbeat our swords into plowshares and our spears into pruning hooks\u201d so that \u201cnations will not take up arms against other nations, nor will they study war anymore.\u201d (See Isaiah 2:3-4)\nTo me, our \u201cmagical moment\u201d took place almost 2,000 years ago.\nWhen this Messiah was born a legion of angels appeared in the heavens shouting \u201cPeace on earth! Goodwill to all mankind!\u201d\n\n\nWhen this Prince of Peace arrived, he affirmed the path of peace and the power of weakness.\nHe told us \u201cMy Kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my disciples would fight.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not, and so we don\u2019t.\nJesus \u2013 the One this President and every other US President has claimed to follow \u2013 told us this:\n\u201cPeace I leave with you; my peace I give you.\xa0I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled\xa0and do not be afraid.\u201d (John 14:27)\nJust in case you\u2019ve not been paying attention, this is how the \u201cworld gives us\u201d peace:\n\u201cIn confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense\u2026.As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.\u201d\nBut this is NOT the way that Jesus brings us peace. His peace is based on loving our enemies, turning the other cheek, and blessing those who curse us. His peace involves admitting that we have been trying this way \u2013 building stronger weapons and bigger armies \u2013 for millennia now. None of this has ever led us to peace. It has only led us to more violence.\n\n\nPeace is not based on stockpiling nuclear weapons capable of vaporizing the entire planet several times over\u2026and then claiming that we just need a few hundred more to make sure.\nAt what point do we admit the insanity of this way of thinking?\nRemember: The definition of insanity is doing the same thing, over and over, expecting different results.\nA very wise man once told us: \u201cThose who live by the sword will die by the sword.\u201d But no one takes that guy very seriously anymore. At least, no one who has an Empire to lead.\nPerhaps this is why Leo Tolstoy was prompted to write:\n\u201cAll churches that unite with state power are not only un-christian, but are always the most vicious enemies of Christianity.\u201d\nOf course, all of this could very easily be remedied if Christians in America would untangle themselves from the Empire and pledge allegiance to the Lamb of God.\nThen there would be no confusion about who they follow and what they believe. They could get on with their mission to live out the Gospel and demonstrate the transformational power of Christ to make us new creatures who overcome evil with good.\n\n\nAt the very least, if we could untangle our faith from politics, there would be no opportunity for the leader of an Empire to call himself a \u201cChristian\u201d while contradicting everything that Jesus stood for.\nTo be clear: I am NOT saying that Empires should be run according to the teachings of Jesus. I\u2019m saying that Christians should not be running Empires.\nLet those who follow Jesus get busy following His commands to love God and love others until the kingdoms of this world become the Kingdom of our God.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of the Amazon Best-Seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and he also co-hosts the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.

195,Do You Follow Christ or Anti-Christ?,"February 1, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nChrist warned us that after he went away, many others would come claiming, falsely, to be the Christ. Our task is to clearly recognize those who claim to be of Christ but, in reality, are not.\nTo that end, it\u2019s helpful to remind ourselves who Jesus was and what Jesus said. If we can clearly recognize the original, then we will never accept anything, or anyone, who takes the name of Christ but stands opposed to His character or His teaching.\n\n\nSo, if Jesus is the Prince of Peace, then the anti-Christ is the Prince of War.\nIf Jesus heals, the anti-Christ sheds blood.\nIf Jesus says we should love our enemy, the anti-Christ says we should torture them.\nIf Jesus commands us to bless those who curse us, the anti-Christ suggests we go to war against them.\nIf Jesus says we should pray for those who persecute us, the anti-Christ says we ought to oppress and imprison them.\nIf Jesus tells us to care for the poor, the anti-Christ says we should just ignore them, or displace them, or criminalize them.\n\n\nIf Jesus says his disciples will not fight, the anti-Christ creates weapons and tells us it\u2019s our\xa0right to use violence.\nIf Jesus says we should turn the other cheek, the anti-Christ says we should destroy those who oppose us or insult us.\nNow, I have to ask you: Who does the Church resemble most?\nAre we of Christ, or are we of the anti-Christ?\n\n\nDo we follow those who contradict our\xa0King? Or do we recognize their attempts to nullify His commands?\nDo we turn our backs on His teaching? Or do we keep our eyes on the One who said \u201cLove your enemies.\xa0Turn the other cheek. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you.\u201d?\nIf we are not following Christ, then we are following the Anti-Christ.\nNo one can serve two masters.\nMake your choice.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast which you can hear on iTunes and Podbean.

196,How Jesus Changed Everyone\u2019s Mind About Sacrifice,"February 1, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nFor thousands of years, every major culture saw blood sacrifice as an acceptable \u2013 even essential \u2013 means of worship. To appease the gods one must shed blood \u2013 human or animal \u2013 so that rain would fall, crops would grow and soldiers would be victorious in battle. This was the unquestionable center of all religious activity for cultures all over the world for centuries.\nToday, however, the practice of blood sacrifice is almost universally regarded by everyone as barbaric, archaic and primitive. No one today would ever seriously consider animal sacrifices as a viable method of worship.\n\n\nImage: Pixabay\nWhat happened to change all of this? Why has everyone completely changed their mind about blood sacrifice?\nIt\u2019s Jesus.\nSee, just as the prophet Daniel was told in his vision, the Messiah to come would \u201cput an end to sacrifice and offerings.\u201d [Dan. 9:27]\nThis is exactly what Jesus did. As the \u201cLamb of God who takes away the sins of the world,\u201d Jesus was the sacrifice to end all sacrifices. He not only fulfilled the shadow of the Jewish sacrificial system \u2013 which remains dormant to this very day after nearly 2,000 years \u2013 Jesus also exposed the entire scapegoating mechanism. He disarmed it by bringing it out into the light and allowing everyone to see it for it really was: A broken system that punished one for the sins of many.\nThis is why, today, no one can take this sacrificial system seriously anymore.\nJesus brought an end to the daily sacrifice, not just for Jews, but for the entire world.\n\n\nIn short: Jesus changed our minds about animal sacrifices. The wisest of the Greeks and the Romans \u2013 Plato, Aristotle, Homer, Socrates, etc. \u2013 all widely accepted this blood sacrifice system as \u201cnormal\u201d and acceptable worship. Not one of them challenged the status quo.\nBut Jesus said to the Pharisees: \u201cGo and learn what this means: \u2018I desire mercy, not sacrifice\u2019\u201d in Matthew 9:13, quoting from Hosea 6:6, which challenged the status quo of the entire human race on the question of worship by animal sacrifice.\nJesus questioned the sacrificial system and affirmed that the way to please God was to show mercy to others, not to offer blood sacrifices.\nIn other words: It\u2019s not death that pleases God, it\u2019s your life.\nHow we live, then, matters a great deal to God. Jesus gave us a radical pattern of mercy, love, and forgiveness to follow in His Sermon on the Mount, and then He invited us to walk in that same path as He did.\nThis is how we please God: We live lives of love and mercy in the here and now. We bless those who curse us. We do good to those who hate us. We overcome evil with good. We forgive as we have been forgiven. We love as He loved us, (which is to say, a whole lot).\n\n\n\n\nPaul uses the term \u201cliving sacrifices\u201d in Romans 12; something that must have been the ultimate oxymoron to anyone living at the time.\nHow can a \u201csacrifice\u201d \u2013 which is all about knives and blood and burning flesh \u2013 ever be \u201cliving\u201d?\nBut, if what Jesus says is true, then it is our life that pleases God; it is our life that makes the difference, not our death, our anyone else\u2019s.\nToday the concept of a sacrifice is still viable, even outside of religious context. But the idea now is more like when parents sacrifice their own comfort so their children can go to college or have a better life than they did. We understand now that a good sacrifice is when one person voluntarily gives up something valuable so that someone else can enjoy the blessing. (Kind of like what Jesus modelled for us).\nNo one today would ever see this as \u201cappeasing the gods\u201d, but the principle is still the same: Whenever we give up something of value in order to bless someone else, this is a very beautiful thing.\nAlso, when Jesus says: \u201cI desire mercy, not sacrifice,\u201d I believe He is letting us know what really matters in His Kingdom.\n\n\nInstead of killing an animal, or shedding blood, to appease the Deity and receive blessings, we are expected to show mercy and love and forgiveness to one another. As Jesus said, \u201cNow that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.\u201d (John 13:17)\nPlease understand: It is not mere knowledge that unlocks the blessing for us, it is the act of putting this knowledge into practice. So, if we now understand that what God requires is not sacrifice but mercy, kindness, forgiveness, and love, then once we begin to live our lives this way, we will begin to experience the blessings, or the fruit, of that obedience. Not only us, but the entire world. Because the model that Jesus has passed on to us is that we are to bless others \u2013 even our enemies \u2013 with the same extravagance as He has shown to us.\nThis is the way we move forward as a society. This is how we make the world better: We love one another as He has loved us. We turn the other cheek. We bless those who curse us. We show mercy to the unmerciful. We feed our enemy if he is hungry and share a cold cup of water if they are thirsty. This is the ultimate expression of the new heaven and the new earth.\n\n\nAll that remains is for those who hear these words to put them into practice. When we do this, two things happen, according to Jesus: We are blessed and He is truly our Lord.\nNow, go and learn what this means.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast which you can hear on iTunes and Podbean.

197,Terms of Surrender,"January 30, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\u201cJust then a man came up to Jesus and asked, \u201cTeacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?\u201d (Matt 19:16)\n\xa0\nImage: Pixabay\nHere are some things to consider as you meditate on this scripture:\xa0First, notice that the Rich Young Ruler\u2019s question to Jesus was \u201cWhat good thing must I do to get eternal life?\u201d (v.16)In response to that question, Jesus says, \u201cSell all that you have and give it to the poor and then come and follow me.\u201d (v.21)Throughout the Gospels, several other people come to Jesus and ask him this exact same question.\n\n\nGuess what? Jesus never gives the same answer to anyone twice.Why?I think it\u2019s because Jesus is able to look into the hearts of those who are asking and he can see what is holding them back from submitting themselves to him as their King, and therefore what needs to change in order for them to enter the Kingdom of God.For Nicodemus, a wise and well-respected Pharisee, the terms of surrender were to become like a baby again and start over from the beginning with a new birth.\xa0For the Rich Young Ruler, it was letting go of his wealth.For Peter, it was walking away from the biggest catch of fish he had ever had in his entire life.For Matthew, it was quitting his job as a tax collector on the spot to follow Jesus.For Zaccheus, it was giving half of his possessions to the poor and paying back four times the money he had extorted as a tax collector.\n\n\nFor the Thief on the Cross, it was simply recognizing that Jesus was a King who would soon be coming into His Kingdom.\nIn every case, the terms of surrender were unique to the individual.\xa0So, what is it that\u2019s holding you back from following Jesus with your actual life today? \n\n\nIf it\u2019s your great wealth or your love of money, then maybe that\u2019s what Jesus would ask you to surrender to Him. \nIf it\u2019s your intellect and your position of respect and authority in the community, maybe it\u2019s complete humility and the willingness to become simple and foolish in the eyes of men in order to identify yourself as a follower of Jesus. \nIf it\u2019s your job, then maybe you should walk away from it like Peter and Matthew did to follow Him.\nFor some people, it\u2019s forgiving someone who hurt us. For still others, it\u2019s turning the other cheek and loving our enemy.For each of us, there is probably that one thing that we would find difficult to surrender to Jesus in order to enter the Kingdom.\xa0What, if anything, is keeping you from seeing the Kingdom or following Jesus today? \n\n\nHonestly, that\u2019s all that we really need to ask ourselves.\nIf you\u2019re brave, please share with me in the comments below the \u201cone thing\u201d that, for you, is the hardest thing to trust Jesus with.\nLetting go of what we have in this world is easy when we understand that Jesus doesn\u2019t want to deprive us of anything. He really only wants to give us Himself and His Kingdom, which is worth so much more than anything in this life. Once we understand that, we should be eager to let go of anything that takes His place in our lives or anything that prevents us from fully knowing Jesus as He really is.\nThe really, really good news? Jesus promises that whatever we surrender in this life will be restored to us a hundredfold. So, really, there\u2019s no risk at all. Talk about a money-back guarantee!\nNow, what the terms of your surrender?\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast on iTunes and Podbean.

198,Am I Supposed to Love Someone Enough to Tell Them the Truth?,"January 27, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\n\n[Guest Post by Steve Kline]\n\u201cI love them enough to tell them the truth.\u201d\nI put these words in quotes because they were spoken by Anita Bryant in a television interview in the 1970s. I had never heard of Ms. Bryant until I saw a clip of her interview in a movie. Ms. Bryant was a Christian political activist known for opposing gay rights.\n\n\nThe \u201cthem\u201d that Ms. Bryant loved enough to tell the truth to were homosexuals. The truth she was willing to tell them was that Jesus loved homosexuals, but if they did not repent from sinning, from being homosexual, they were going to hell. Presumably, Ms. Bryant found it tough to say these words, but she loved homosexuals enough to tell homosexuals this truth.\nHowever, I have learned that this statement \u2013 \u201cI love them enough to tell them the truth\u201d \u2013 is, in reality, the whitewashing of an inner hatred by the one who says them. These words reveal the inner hatred of the speaker because the speaker is willing to cast the hearer into hell if the hearer does not obey whatever law, rule, principle, or moral standard the speaker believes the hearer is violating. The speaker couches these words in love, but in reality the words are accusatory and designed to cast out from the speaker\u2019s presence or community the individual they deem offensive, abominable, repulsive, or reprehensible.\nSo, after hearing Ms. Bryant say these words, I was not surprised to learn that she also loved homosexuals enough to tell them they were \u201chuman garbage.\u201d\nBut, Anita Bryant is not the only, and likely not the first, Christian to use these words. I have heard quite a few Christians say, \u201cI love them enough to tell them the truth.\u201d And, I have heard these words applied to all sorts of people, not just homosexuals. I have even seen these words directed at people that someone has never met but simply disagreed with in an online discussion. And, while most Christians may not be so bold as tell others they are \u201chuman garbage,\u201d the message is received nonetheless.\n\n\nAfter hearing Ms. Bryant say these words, I asked myself if they were true.\nAs a Christian, am I supposed to love someone enough to tell them the truth?\nHaving thought about it, my answer is no.\nA resounding no, actually.\nAs a Christian, I am not supposed to love someone enough to tell them the truth.\nI am not supposed to love someone to tell them the supposedly difficult words that if they do not stop sinning then they are going to die and spend eternity in hell.\nFirst, that is not the truth that Christians are to preach. Christians preach the gospel, which is Jesus, the word of God, was born a man, suffered, was crucified, died, and rose from the dead for repentance and the forgiveness of sins. Repentance is about changing our minds about who God is not who we are. When our mind is changed about who God is, then we know and receive his complete and total forgiveness for being God\u2019s enemy even though God did nothing but love us. That\u2019s good news, gospel.\nSecond, scripture shows that Jesus placed far more emphasis on loving someone enough to show them the truth. Jesus spent three and a half years telling people the truth about what God is like. But, Jesus showed them the truth on the cross in a far greater way than the truth could ever be told. In fact, Jesus\u2019 suffering and death on the cross was so powerful that \u201cwhen the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, \u2018Truly this man was the Son of God!\u2019\u201d (Mark 15.39) Do not gloss over what Mark is telling us. A Roman centurion, the enemy of the Jews,\xa0 who Jesus never told the truth to, saw this innocent man unjustly suffering and dying and was recorded as the first to say that Jesus was the son of God.\n\n\nLuke 24.44-47 says, \u201cThen he said to them, \u2018These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.\u2019 Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, \u2018Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.\u2019\u201d\nThe Christ should suffer and rise from the dead for repentance and the forgiveness of sins. That is the truth.\nThe scripture told the truth. And, the truth was missed.\nJesus showed the truth. And, the truth was received.\nSo, as a Christian, if I am not supposed to love someone enough to tell them the truth, then what I am supposed to do?\nI am to love someone, anyone, everyone, enough to show them the truth.\nHow do I show someone the truth?\nThe same way Jesus did.\nSuffer.\nDie.\n\u201cGod is love.\u201d (1 John 4.8)\nLove is not just merely an action God does. God\xa0is\xa0love. God\u2019s very being, his very essence, is love.\n\n\n\u201cIn this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\u201d (1 John 4.9-10)\nThe love of God was manifest. God\u2019s love was made to appear. It was shown.\nHow?\n\n\nBecause Jesus was sent so that we might live through him. This is the repentance spoken of in Luke 24.47. Seeing Jesus\u2019 suffering and death changes our minds about God so that we can truly live in him. We repent so that we can live through Jesus.\nBecause Jesus was sent to be the propitiation for our sins. This is the forgiveness of sins spoken of in Luke 24.47. Seeing Jesus\u2019 suffering and death, that was caused by our own hands, yet hearing him say, \u201cFather, forgive them, for they know not what they do,\u201d causes us to be propitiated, which means within ourselves we have regained the favor or goodwill that God has always had toward us.\nThis is the love that Jesus showed, not told, us on the cross. Therefore, Jesus said, \u201cAnd I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.\u201d (John 12.32)\n\n\n\u201cBeloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.\u201d (1 John 4.11-12)\nIf you know that God showed you his love in Christ\u2019s suffering and death, then you should show that love in the same way.\nWhy?\nBecause no one has ever seen God. But, if you show love, by suffering and dying as Christ did, then God will abide in you. If God abides in you, then others will see God in you through your love.\nTherefore Jesus said, \u201cA new commandment I give to you, that you love another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another.\u201d (John 13.34-35)\nYou show God\u2019s love not tell it.\nYou show God\u2019s love by suffering and dying.\nThis is why Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.\u201d(Luke 9.23)\nContemplate 1 Corinthians 13, which is considered by some the greatest statement about love. Notice how the chapter starts.\n\n\n\u201cIf I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.\u201d (1 Corinthians 13.1)\nYou can speak in any and every earthly and heavenly language, but if there is not love, if there is not suffering and dying with and for another, then you are just noise, an irritating, grating, annoying, ear-piercing noise.\nIn reality, this is the very definition of \u201cI love them enough to tell them the truth.\u201d When you say those words, you are heard as a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.\nPaul continued, \u201cAnd If I have prophetic powers\u2026but have not love, I am nothing.\u201d (1 Corinthians 13.2)\nProphetic power is a God-given ability to reveal the will of God in heaven by speaking so that things on the earth are changed and conformed to the will of God. But, if that prophetic power, that speaking, is without love, you are nothing.\nThen Paul defined love.\n\u201cLove is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends.\u201d (1 Corinthians 13.4-8)\n\n\nIt does not come across well in English, but, in the Greek, all the things that love \u201cis\u201d are actually verbs. Paul is not describing what love is but what love does.\nLove doesn\u2019t tell.\nLove shows.\nAnd, love shows by suffering and dying with and for another.\nPaul stated this clearly in Philippians 2.1-11. We are to be \u201cof the same mind, having the same love\u201d as Jesus. We are to \u201chave this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.\u201d This same mind, this same love is \u201cbecoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.\u201d\nAs Christians, the love of Christ controls us. Christ\u2019s love controls us when we suffer and die for others just as he did. We show the truth \u2013 that God is love \u2013 when we enter into another\u2019s suffering. We suffer with them. We bear their burden with them. This is the message and ministry of reconciliation that Christians have been given. But, we don\u2019t count their trespasses against them. In other words, we don\u2019t \u201clove them enough to tell them the truth.\u201d (2 Corinthians 5.11-21)\nIn Romans 12.9-21, Paul paraphrased the sermon on the mount. \u201cLet love be genuine.\u201d Love should be sincere, without hypocrisy. You can\u2019t tell someone you love them but threaten them with eternal torment in hell if they don\u2019t stop sinning. That type of telling is not love-based but fear-based. \u201cThere is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.\u201d (1 John 4.18) Paul then wrote that genuine love is shown by living out all that Jesus said in the sermon on the mount. He concluded with \u201cif your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.\u201d\n\n\nEnemies are not converted by loving them enough to tell them the truth.\nEnemies are converted by showing them love, entering their suffering, meeting their needs. If they are thirsty, then give them a drink. If they are hungry, then feed them. If they are homeless, then house them. If they are broken, then comfort them.\nTherefore, the real question, the real test, for a Christian is this \u2013 do I love you enough to show you, through my own suffering and death, literal death if necessary, the truth that God loves you?\nBy Steve Kline\n**\nSteve Kline blogs at Living Room Theology.

199,10 Reasons Why Jesus Surpasses the Law and the Prophets,"January 26, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nThere are at least 10 different verses in the New Testament that very specifically identify Jesus as the one and only example for what the Father is really like.\nImage: Pixabay\nBefore I share those verses with you here, let me ask you to notice a few things:\n\n\nFirst, notice that in nearly every case Jesus is either explicitly contrasted with the Old Testament Prophets, or it is implicitly suggested that He is the superior source for information about who God is and what God is like.\nSecondly, please notice that whenever the New Testament says something about Jesus, it doesn\u2019t affirm that the Old Testament was right and Jesus confirmed it. Instead, it often either ignores what the Old Testament claims or flat-out contradicts it.\nThis is pretty significant, really. Because it\u2019s not as if the authors of the New Testament were ignorant about what the Old Testament said about God. Yet, their claims about Jesus very boldly supersede those claims made by the Law and the Prophets.\nTo help you see this, I will point out examples of how these explicit and implicit contrasts are made between Jesus and the Old Testament prophets, just in case they are not obvious.\nReady? Ok, here we go, according to the New Testament:\n1) Who does God speak to us through today?\xa0(Not Moses. Not Elijah.)\n\n\nJesus.\n\u201cIn the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe. The Son is the radiance of God\u2019s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.\u201d (Hebrews 1:1\u20133, NIV)\n2) Who is the one mediator between God and man?\xa0(Not the Law. Not the Prophets.)\nJesus.\n\u201cFor there is one God\xa0and one mediator\xa0between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus\u2026\u201d\xa0(1 Tim. 2:5)\n3) Who is the one instructor who teaches us?\xa0(Not the Law. Not the Prophets.)\nJesus.\n\u201cFor you have one instructor \u2013 the Messiah.\u201d (Matt. 23:10)\n4) Who is the one we should listen to?\xa0(Not Moses. Not Elijah.)\nJesus.\n\n\n*After removing Moses [the Law] and Elijah [the Prophets], God says:\xa0\u201cThis is my Son. Listen to Him!\u201d\xa0(Matt. 17:4-6)\n5) Who is the only one who removes the veil that covers the Old Testament scriptures?\nOnly Jesus.\n\u201cFor to this day,\xa0when they read\xa0the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts.\xa0But when\xa0one\xa0turns to the Lord,\xa0the veil is removed.\u201d\xa0\xa0(2. Cor. 3:14-16)\n6) Where is the one place we can go to find life?\xa0(Not to the scriptures.)\nJesus.\n\u201cYou search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.\u201d [John 4:39-40]\n7) Who is the only one who has ever seen God at any time?\xa0(Not Moses. Not Elijah.)\n\n\nJesus.\n\u201cNo one has ever seen God, but God, the one and only [Jesus] makes Him known.\u201d [John 1:17-18]\n8) Who is the \u201cWord of God\u201d?\xa0(Not your Bible.)\nJesus.\n\u201cIn the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God\u2026and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.\u201d [John 1:1; 14)\n9) Who reveals the Truth to us about the Father?\n\xa0No one but Jesus.\n\u201cWhoever has seen me has seen the Father.\u201d (John 14:9)\n\u201cJesus said to him,\xa0\u201cI am\xa0the way, and\xa0the truth, and\xa0the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\xa0If you had known me, you would have\xa0known my Father also.\u201d (John 14:6-7)\nPlease note\xa0in this list of scriptures above how easy it would have been for the New Testament writers to affirm the Old Testament and exalt Jesus at the same time.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not what they do.\nFor example, in John 1:17-18, if the author had intended to protect the witness of the Old Testament prophets who claimed they saw God and wanted to affirm their testimony about God\u2019s character,\xa0how easy it would have been to say something like this:\n\u201cWhereas Moses and Elijah had also seen God in the past, Jesus came from God as the Word made flesh to confirm their testimony.\u201d\nBut, what he wrote sounds nothing like that. Not at all. It says this:\n\u201cNo one has ever seen God, but God, the one and only [Jesus] makes Him known.\u201d (John 1:17-18)\nThat\u2019s pretty harsh. It\u2019s almost as if John is trying to make a point here. He wants to say that, until Jesus came, we did not have an accurate revelation about who God was and what God was like.\nLet\u2019s think of it another way: Let\u2019s say that John wanted to communicate to us that Jesus\u2019s testimony about the Father was accurate but the testimony of the Old Testament Prophets was inaccurate. How might he do that? Maybe he would say something like:\n\n\n\u201cNo one except Jesus has seen the Father. Jesus came to reveal the Father to us because our ideas about God were less than exact.\u201d\nOr\u2026he might say it like this:\n\u201cNo one has ever seen God at any time, but God, the one and only [Jesus] makes Him known.\u201d (John 1:17-18)\nNow, we shouldn\u2019t assume that Matthew was just using hyperbole or that he had a momentary lapse of memory. Clearly, he was aware that there was something called the Old Testament and that people in the past, like Moses and Elijah, had claimed to see God and to hear from Him.\nThat\u2019s why his statement is so radical:\xa0\u201cNo one has ever seen God\u2026\u201d\nThe same could be said for every other verse above. If the authors had wanted to affirm the Old Testament, they had every opportunity to do so. Instead, they very boldly contrast Jesus with the Law and the Prophets and emphasize the supremacy of Christ.\nNow, before you break out the pitchforks let me say that I do believe the Law and the Prophets point us to Christ. In fact, they do that beautifully. We should be very grateful for the Old Testament scriptures that foreshadow the coming of Jesus.\n\n\nJesus Himself said that He did not come to abolish the Law and the Prophets but to fulfill them, and this is exactly what He did.\xa0\nBecause of this fulfillment, those scriptures have become obsolete and are fading away. [See Hebrews 8:13; 2 Cor. 3:7-11; Gal.4:30-31]\nWhat we have now is the Living Word who is alive inside us.\nHe has written His law on our hearts. This is what the new covenant is all about. [See Jeremiah 31:31]\nSo, if anyone is to blame for pitting Jesus against Moses or Elijah, or against the Old Testament scriptures, it\u2019s Paul, Matthew, John and the author of Hebrews, not me.\nAll I\u2019ve done here is to quote those verses that they wrote and pointed out the obvious.\nThe rest, I believe, speaks for itself.\n10) \u201cFor\xa0the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\u201d (John 1:17)\nIf I am guilty of anything, it is that I have taken those 10 verses above at face value and I have exalted Jesus above everyone and everything else.\n\n\nThat\u2019s something I can live with.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and the co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast on iTunes and Podbean.

200,How Selective Tolerance Leads To More Violence,"January 25, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nMany Christians are more interested in making lists of all the ways that Islam is wrong and Christianity is right than they are in finding common ground with Muslims.\n\nIs this because Christians are really unable to set aside their religious differences to embrace someone of another faith?\n\nNot exactly.\n\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\n\nFor example, most Christians I know fully embrace Judaism. They love the Jewish faith. They use Jewish terms for Jesus and Messiah [\u201cYeshua\u201d, \u201cMashiac\u201d, etc.]. They wear the Star of David proudly. They observe the Jewish Passover meal. They even pray for the peace of Israel.\n\nBut why?\n\n\nThe Jewish faith denies that Christ is the Messiah. They refuse to accept that Jesus is born of a virgin. They do not believe that Jesus performed miracles. They do not believe that Jesus ascended into Heaven. They do not believe that Jesus is alive today or that Jesus is returning to judge the world.\n\n\nBut none of that matters to most Evangelical Christians today.\nThey are totally capable of enthusiastically overlooking all of that for the sake of what we have in common with Judaism \u2013 which is namely the Old Testament scriptures.\nNow, just imagine that the Jews DID believe all of these things. Could you imagine American Christians rejecting the Jewish people?\nBut they DO reject Muslims who happen to affirm all of these things about Jesus!\nIslam teaches that:\n\u2013 Jesus is the \u201cWord of God\u201d\n\u2013 Jesus is the \u201cSpirit of God\u201d\n\u2013 Jesus is \u201cthe Messiah\u201d\n\u2013 Jesus creates life\n\u2013 Jesus cured a man born blind, and a man with leprosy.\n\u2013 Jesus gives life to dead people.\n\u2013 Jesus went to heaven.\n\u2013 Jesus is still alive today.\n\u2013 Jesus will come again to judge the entire world.\n[See chapter 3, verses 45-55, the Qu\u2019ran]\nCan you imagine rejecting someone who believed all of these things about Jesus?\n\n\nCan you imagine refusing to engage in a dialog with someone who already had such an amazing foundation of faith in Jesus?\n\n\nYet, somehow, Christians feel totally ok embracing one faith which denies all of these things about Jesus while rejecting another faith which affirms all of the same things about Him.\nDoes this make any sense?\nNot to me, it doesn\u2019t.\nYou have a choice. You can either:\n\nA) Keep making lists of all the ways you are right and Muslims are wrong\nOR\nB) Look for how much you have in common with them about Jesus and enter into a fruitful dialog with a Muslim about Him.\nOne path will result in more division and violence.\nThe other path will result in an amazing conversation of Jesus with a Muslim and the opportunity for understanding and peace.\nSo\u2026what are you most interested in here?\nAs long as you are only interested in seeking a path for opposition and division, you will keep on making those lists of how \u201cwrong\u201d they are.\nBut, if you are ready to start seeking a path for peace, and for reconciliation, you will take full advantage of an amazing opportunity to talk with a Muslim about Jesus.\nWhat would a religion of peace really teach you to do here?\nIf you really belong to a peaceful religion, then take the path of peace: Engage in an open dialog with a Muslim about all that you have in common with them about Jesus.\n\n\nI dare you.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.

201,"While You Wait For Jesus, Creation Waits For You","January 23, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nIf I were to ask you, \u201cWhat is it that all Creation is awaiting eagerly?\u201d You would most likely say, \u201cThe return of Jesus!\u201d\nAnd you would be wrong.\nImage: Pixabay\nNo, instead, what Paul says is that all Creation is waiting eagerly for those who are in Christ to awaken and rise up.\n\n\n\u201cFor the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.\xa0For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope\xa0\xa0that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.\u201d [Romans 8:19-21]\nAll Creation is eagerly awaiting the Body of Christ to rise up and bring forth the Kingdom of God which lies within each of us. Like tiny seeds of mustard pressed into the dry ground or a light sprinkling of yeast that spreads within the lump of dough, we are the promise of a Kingdom to come that all Creation yearns for.\nOr, to put it another way:\n\u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us\u2026and now the Word of God is still dwelling in our flesh right now, all over the world.\u201d\nThis has always been part of the Father\u2019s Master Plan \u2013 to transform us so that we can transform the kingdoms of this world into the Kingdom of God. [See Revelation 11:15]\nForget about \u201cwinning America back for God\u201d, our mission is to usher in the Eternal Kingdom of God \u2013 where His perfect will is always accomplished in the lives of His people \u2013 and to transform others around us into people who are also carrying around the promise of the Kingdom within.\nIt\u2019s not about turning America into a nation where Christians feel more comfortable and \u201cat home\u201d. It\u2019s about changing people into transformational agents of the Kingdom who are radiating love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, mercy and perseverance. Truth be told, if we start doing that our communities will start to be anything but \u201ccomfortable\u201d, but never boring.\nJust before this passage in Romans, Paul says something wonderful about our identity in Christ as \u201cChildren of God\u201d:\n\u201cFor those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.\xa0The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to son-ship. And by him we cry, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d\xa0\xa0The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God\u2019s children.\xa0Now if we are children, then we are heirs\u2014heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.\u201d [Roman 8: 14-17]\n\n\nAs the Children of God, we are:\n\n\u201cLed by the Spirit\u201d\n\u201cWithout fear\u201d\n\u201cHeirs of God\u201d\n\u201cCo-heirs with Christ\u201d\n\u201cSharing in the sufferings and the glory of Jesus\u201d\n\n\n\nIn fact, it is this process of suffering that is key to what Paul is saying in this passage. This is why he says:\n\u201cI consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.\u201d [v. 18]\nPlease notice: Paul does not say that our sufferings don\u2019t compare to Heaven, or to a place we will go when Jesus comes back.\nNope. Look again.\nPaul says,\xa0\u201cOur present sufferings are not worth comparing with the GLORY THAT WILL BE REVEALED IN US.\u201d[Emphasis mine]\nWhat is this glory that will be revealed in us? It\u2019s the very same glory that Paul says \u201call creation waits in eager expectation for\u201d when \u201cthe children of God are revealed\u201d!\nHe encourages us to endure suffering in this life, because through that suffering for the Kingdom and the Gospel of Jesus, we are being transformed into His image and we are fulfilling our call as seeds and as yeast to usher in the glorious Kingdom of God in the here and now.\nAll creation is groaning for you and me to wake up, step out, and begin to live as citizens of the Kingdom of God at this very moment in time.\n\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\nIf you keep waiting perhaps even the rocks will cry out, \u201cHurry! Child of God! Liberate us from this bondage and decay! Bring forth the glorious freedom of the Lord Jesus, our King!\u201d\nLet\u2019s not delay any longer.\nRise up, oh sleeper.

202,Answering Questions About the Old Covenant and the New Covenant,"January 18, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\nWhy do you say the Old Covenant is \u201cobsolete\u201d?\nBecause in Hebrews 8:13 we read:\xa0\u201cBy calling this covenant \u201cnew,\u201d he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.\u201d\n\n\nBut, how can the OT be obsolete if Jesus said he did not come to abolish the Law but to fulfill it?\nJesus said: \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\xa0I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.\u201d ( Matthew 5:17-18)\nThere are two qualifiers here: One is that the Law will not disappear \u201cuntil Heaven and Earth disappear\u201d, and\xa0the second qualifier\xa0is that the Law will not disappear until \u201ceverything is accomplished.\u201d\nSo, first Jesus assures us that His mission is to fulfill or to accomplish the Law, and then He tells us that the Law will not disappear \u201cuntil everything is accomplished.\u201d\n\u201cWas everything accomplished?\u201d\nAnd the answer is: Yes!\n\u201cWhen he had received the drink, Jesus said, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.\u201d (John 19:30)\n\n\nThe Greek word Jesus used here is literally \u201caccomplished\u201d.\nSo here, on the cross, Jesus declares that He has accomplished His mission to \u201cfulfill the Law\u201d, just as He set out to do.\nPlus, Jesus prayed to the Father before the cross and confirmed: \u201cI have glorified You on earth by\xa0accomplishing\xa0the work\xa0You gave Me to do\u201d [John 17:4]\nWhat does that mean, then, according to the two qualifiers Jesus placed on the Law? It means that since everything has been accomplished, the Law has now disappeared.\nMaybe this is why Paul the Apostle told us that, on the cross, Jesus actually DID \u201cabolish the Law\u201d by fulfilling (or \u201caccomplishing\u201d) it?\n\u201cFor He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one, and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,\xa0by abolishing in His flesh\xa0the enmity, which is\xa0the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace.\u201d (Eph. 2:15)\nElsewhere Paul also affirms for us that \u201cChrist is the\xa0end of the law.\u201d \xa0(Rom. 10:4).\nFurthermore, Paul explains for us the differences between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant \u2013 not once but twice.\nThe first time, in 2 Corinthians, Paul contrasts the Old and the New Covenant saying:\n\u201cNow if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, [that\u2019s the Old Covenant] came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was, [the Old was \u201cfading\u201d] will not the ministry of the Spirit [that\u2019s the New Covenant] be even more glorious?\u201d\n\u201cIf the ministry that condemns men [the Old] is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness! [that\u2019s the New] For what was glorious [the Old] has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory. And if what was fading away [the Old] came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts! [the New] \u2013 (2 Corinthians 3:7-11)\nSo, Paul tells us the following about the Old Covenant:\n\nIt brought death\nIts glory was fading\nIt condemns men\nIt was glorious (past tense)\nIt now has no glory\nIt is fading away\n\n\n\n\xa0\nThe New Covenant, in contrast :\n\nIs More glorious than the Old Covenant\nBrings righteousness\nHas a glory that is surpassing\nIs everlasting\n\nThe second contrast and comparison that Paul does between the Old and the New Covenant is here in Galatians:\n\u201cThe women (Hagar and Sarah) represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.\u201d (Galatians 4:24-26)\n\u201cBut what does Scripture say? \u201cGet rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman\u2019s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman\u2019s son.\u201d Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.\u201d (Gal.4: 30-31)\nNow what does Paul say about the Old Covenant?\nThe Old Covenant:\n\nIs from Mount Sinai (where the 10 Commandments were given)\nBears children who are slaves\nCorresponds to the earthly Jerusalem\nIs in slavery with her children\nShould be cast out of our presence\nWill not share in the inheritance of Christ\nIs not our Mother\n\n\n\n\xa0\nPaul says the New Covenant:\n\nBears children who are free\nIs of the heavenly\xa0 New Jerusalem, not the physical city\nIs our true Mother\nShares in the inheritance of Christ\n\n\xa0\nTo drive the point home even further, Paul tells us many times:\n\u201cWe are not under the law\u201d (Rom. 6:14; Gal. 5:18).\n\u201cWe are dead to the law\u201d (Rom. 7:4).\n\u201cWe are delivered from the law\u201d (Rom. 7:6).\nTherefore, those who are in Christ are not under the Ten Commandments but under the \u201cLaw of Christ\u201d as Paul says:\n\u201cCarry each other\u2019s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.\u201d (Galatians 6:2)\nBut what about the Jewish people, then? Aren\u2019t they God\u2019s Chosen people?\nThat depends on what you mean by \u201cIsrael\u201d and \u201cChosen\u201d. Paul pointed out to us that not everyone who claims to be \u201cIsrael\u201d is actually, truly \u201cIsrael\u201d in God\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\xa0\u201cFor not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham\u2019s children.\u201d (Romans 9:6)\nJohn the Baptist said the same thing to the Pharisees who wanted to claim that they were \u201cChildren of Abraham\u201d (or \u201cIsrael\u201d) and therefore blessed and favored of God. He said to them:\n\u201cAnd do not think you can say to yourselves, \u2018We have Abraham as our father.\u2019 I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.\xa0The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\u201d (Matt. 3:9-10)\nSo, the true \u201cIsrael of God\u201d is actually found in Galatians where Paul assures us that:\n\u201cIf you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\u201d (Galatians 3:29)\nWhere does that leave the unbelieving Jewish people?\xa0The answer is troubling, and it should give us sincere pause and cause us to fall on our knees and cry out to God for their salvation.\n\n\n\n\nConsider this:\n\u201cWho is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist\u2014denying the Father and the Son.\u201d (1 John 2:22)\nThe Jewish people today who deny Jesus is the Messiah have neither the Father, nor the Son. They are without christ and they are lost without Him.\nBut I thought they were God\u2019s \u201cChosen\u201d people?\nConsider what the Apostle Peter says about the Christians he writes to in his epistle:\n\u201cBut you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,\xa0a holy nation, God\u2019s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.\xa0Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.\u201d (1 Peter 2:9-10)\nWho, then, is the true Israel of God according to the New Testament?\n\n\nAnyone who is in Christ.\nWho are the \u201cChosen people\u201d of God?\nThose who put their hope in Jesus as their Lord and King.\nSo, the Jews are no longer the \u201cChosen people of God\u201d?\nLet\u2019s go back and look at what the Jewish people were \u201cChosen\u201d for in the first place. Were they chosen to be saved? No, because salvation depends upon trust in Christ as Lord and Savior.\nWhat we find is that God chose the Jews to be the people group from whom the Messiah would be born.\xa0 That\u2019s it.\nSo, since Jesus was born a Jew, they have fulfilled their calling. There\u2019s nothing more for them to be \u201cchosen\u201d for.\nChristians, according to Peter, are now the \u201cChosen of God\u201d to carry the message of the Gospel to every nation. This is our calling as God\u2019s \u201cchosen people\u201d.\nHow can you say the 10 Commandments are no longer relevant for Christians today?\n\n\nBecause the 10 commandments were the terms of the Old Covenant (which is obsolete and vanishing).\n\u201cMoses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant\u2014the Ten Commandments.\u201d (Exodus 34:28)\n\u201cHe declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.\u201d (Deut. 4:13)\nThe Ten Commandments are only mentioned (by name) three times in the entire Bible. Here in these two scriptures referenced above, and also in Deut.10:4. But in each case it is clear that God gave the Ten Commandments to the Jews as a Covenant. (Note: There are many other terms used such as \u201cTablets of Stone\u201d, \u201cStone Tables\u201d, etc.)\nAlso because the 10 Commandments were a covenant between Himself and with the Nation of Israel, not with the entire world:\n\u201cThen the Lord said to Moses, \u201cWrite down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.\u201d (Exodus 34:27)\n\n\nWithout this Covenant, the Jewish people had no basis for being called a nation. If this Covenant was in force, then they would have a claim to the promises included in the Covenant, but if they broke this Covenant then they would lose all their status as God\u2019s chosen people and their status as a nation.\n\u201cNow\xa0if\xa0you obey me fully and keep my covenant,\xa0then\xa0out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\u2019 These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.\u201d (Exodus 19:5-6)\nIn much the same way that the Constitution is a document that outlines the laws of our nation and establishes our system of government, the Ten Commandments (or the Law) outlines God\u2019s terms for establishing the nation state of Israel.\nThe terms of Israel\u2019s nationhood are dependent upon a few things. First, it says, \u201cIf\xa0you obey me and keep my covenant,\xa0THEN\xa0you will be my treasured possession.\u201d\n\n\nThat\u2019s a conditional covenant. We know that the History of Israel records their continual disobedience to God and to His covenant. Because they broke their covenant with God, they were scattered over and over again, until finally they nation of Israel was judged in AD 70 during the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, as Jesus predicted it would be (Luke 21) and in the Parable of the Vineyard (Matt. 21:33-46).\nDid you know that the promises connected to the Old Covenant have now been offered unconditionally to those who are under the New Covenant?\nIt\u2019s true! The very same conditional covenant terms spoken to the Jews are repeated in the New Testament as being unconditionally applied to the Church:\n\u201cAs you come to him, the living Stone\u2014rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him\u2014 you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\u201d (1 Peter 2:4-5)\n\u201cBut you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God\u2019s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.\u201d (1 Peter 2:9-10)\n\n\nHere, Peter declares that Christians \u201cARE a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God\u2019s special possession\u2026\u201d. The very same conditional promises originally offered to the Jewish nation in Exodus 19:5-6 are now spoken to the Church as being now in effect. So that anyone who is currently found in Christ is the recipient of these promises to be chosen, of the priesthood, a holy nation and God\u2019s special possession. We are also promised to be called the people of God and to receive mercy.\nThe Good News is that Jesus first came and fulfilled the terms of the Old Covenant, and then He made a New Covenant with anyone who would receive Him as Lord and Savior.\nTHE TERMS OF THE NEW COVENANT\n\xa0\u201cI will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people\u2026and they will all know me from the least to the greatest for I will remember their sins no more.\u201d (Jer. 31:33-34 and Hebrews 8:7-9)\nWe are now under one Covenant, not two. The first has been fulfilled and is now obsolete:\n\n\n\u201cIn speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.\u201d (Hebrew 8:13)\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and the co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.

203,Shocking News About End Times Prophecy,"January 17, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\n\u201cBut the Day of the Lord will come like a thief.\xa0The heavens will disappear with a roar;\xa0the elements will be destroyed by fire,\xa0and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.\u201d (2 Peter 3:10)\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of bad theology out there that frames scriptures like this one in a futurist light, as if what is being described here is some event that has never happened and still needs to occur before Christ returns. But this is the wrong way to read verses like this.\nWhy? Because the \u201cDay of the Lord\u201d was the prophesied destruction of Jerusalem that took place roughly forty years after Jesus predicted it would happen, in 70 AD.\nIf we read 2 Peter 3:10 with this in mind, we may also realize that the Old Heavens and the Old Earth have \u2013 metaphorically \u2013 already been destroyed and replaced with the New Heavens and New Earth.\nFor example, in John\u2019s Revelation of Christ, we read about his vision of the \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d coming down from God out of heaven. This New Jerusalem is also called \u201cThe Bride of Christ\u201d \u2013 which is the Church.\nNotice what John says about this in Revelation 21:1-3:\n\u201cThen I saw \u201ca new heaven and a new earth,\u201d\xa0for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away\u2026I saw the Holy City,\xa0the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,\xa0prepared as a bride\xa0beautifully dressed for her husband.\xa0And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, \u201cLook! God\u2019s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them.\xa0They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.\u201d\n\n\nWhat\u2019s especially significant here is the last part of the verse where the voice proclaims that \u201cGod\u2019s dwelling place is now among the people\u2026\u201d and that \u201cThey will be His people, and God Himself\xa0 will be with them and be their God.\u201d\nThese promises are directly connected to the New Covenant, which Jesus proclaimed in the upper room with His disciples:\n\u201cThis cup is the New Covenant in my blood\u2026\u201d (Luke 22:20)\nWhat is the New Covenant? Most Christians are sadly unaware of this, but it\u2019s essentially this:\n\u201cThis is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0after that time,\u201d declares the\xa0Lord.\n\u201cI will put my law in their minds\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and write it on their hearts.\nI will be their God,\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and they will be my people.\n\xa0No longer will they teach\xa0their neighbor,\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0or say to one another, \u2018Know the\xa0Lord,\u2019\nbecause they will all know\xa0me,\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0from the least of them to the greatest,\u201d\ndeclares the\xa0Lord.\n\u201cFor I will forgive\xa0their wickedness\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and will remember their sins\xa0no more.\u201d (Jeremiah 33:33-34)\n\n\nSo, if Jeremiah prophesied that this New Covenant would be proclaimed,\nand if Jesus already announced it as coming \u201cin his blood\u201d in the upper room,\nand if the terms of this New Covenant are that:\n*God will put His law in our hearts\n*God will be our God and we will be His people\n*Everyone will now have access to knowing God personally\n*God will forgive their sins and remember them no more\nThe bottom line is this: The New Covenant reality is here, right now, today.\nWhat this means is that the prophecy in Revelation about God\u2019s dwelling now being among men has come to pass. We are now the Temple of the Living God where He dwells within every one of us.\n\u201cFor we are the temple\xa0of the living God.\xa0As God has said:\n\u201cI will live with them\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and walk among them,\n and I will be their God,\n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and they will be my people.\u201d (2 Cor. 6:18)\n\n\nNotice that Paul here directly ties this statement about us being God\u2019s temple with the fulfillment of the New Covenant promise \u201cI will be their God and they will be my people.\u201d\n\n\nAll of this is true, right now.\nSo, when Peter writes about the \u201cDay of the Lord\u201d coming when the old creation will be destroyed by fire and the new heavens and the new earth will be established, this is exactly what he is referring to: The end of the Old Covenant and the establishment of the New Covenant.\nThis is why Peter ends that statement by saying:\n\u201c\u2026That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.\xa0But in keeping with his promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth,\xa0where righteousness dwells.\u201d (2 Peter 3:13)\nThe good news is this: The old things have passed away. The new has come. As Paul puts it:\n\u201cTherefore, if anyone is in Christ,\xa0the new creation\xa0has come:\xa0The old has gone, the new is here!\u201d (2 Cor. 5:17)\nWe are living, right now, today, in the New Heaven and the New Earth where God has made His dwelling among men and women.\nJesus wanted us to grasp this truth. This is why He told us:\n\u201cIf anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and\xa0we will come to him and\xa0make our home with him.\u201d (John 14:23)\n\n\nMore than this, this is exactly what Jesus meant when he said:\n\u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish\xa0the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but\xa0to fulfill them.\xa0For truly, I say to you,\xa0until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.\u201c (Matt. 5:17-18)\nSo, did Jesus fulfill the Law and the Prophets? Yes, he did. He completed his earthly mission to fulfill them both, as he confirms in his prayer to his father:\n\u201c\xa0I\xa0glorified you on earth,\xa0having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.\u201d (John 17:4)\nAnd as he confirms from the cross when he exclaims in a loud voice:\n\u201cIt is accomplished!\u201d (John 19:30)\nNotice there were, not one, but two \u201cuntils\u201d in Jesus\u2019s statement about the passing away of the Law and the Prophets.\nOne that, \u201cuntil heaven and earth pass away\u2026\u201d and a second: \u201cuntil all is accomplished\u201d and both are tied to the passing away of the Law and the Prophets.\n\n\nSo, if Jesus did accomplish his intended purpose to fulfill the Law and the Prophets, then they have passed away. This is what Paul and the author of Hebrews both confirm numerous times. (See Eph. 2:15; Rom. 10:4; 2 Cor. 3:7-11; Gal. 4:24-31; and Heb. 8:13)\nBut, notice also that if the Law and the Prophets have been accomplished, then Heaven and Earth may now also pass away. This, metaphorically, is what Peter and John and Paul are all referring to. Not to the literal destruction of the planet, but to the symbolic end of the Old Covenant and the coming of the New Covenant.\nAs John predicted in Revelation 21:1-3, the New Jerusalem has replaced the Old Jerusalem. This city is now composed of people who are in Christ. They are the Bride of Christ. They are the Temple where God now dwells. His home is now among us. He is our God. We are His people. We can all know Him directly, right now.\nThe Kingdom is here and it is wide open.\nWhat are you waiting for?\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and the co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour podcast.

204,When America Celebrated George Washington\u2019s Godhood,"January 15, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\nImage: Pixabay\nRemember when our nation\u2019s leaders commissioned a giant fresco\xa0painting\xa0in the dome of the U.S. Capitol building which depicts George Washington becoming a god and sitting next to other pagan Roman gods like Minerva, Neptune, Vulcan and Mercury?\n\n\nWait\u2026what?\nYes. It\u2019s true.\xa0\nAmerica \u2013 supposedly a \u201cChristian Nation\u201d \u2013 hired an Italian Greek artist in 1865 to paint the inside of the rotunda at the United States Capitol Building. It\u2019s still there today.\nMost Americans \u2013 and certainly most American Christians \u2013 have no idea what it is or what it shows.\nThe Apotheosis of Washington \u2013 literally the \u201cDeification of Washington\u201d which shows the nation\u2019s first president sitting among pagan gods \u2013 was painted over an 11 month time span at the end of the Civil War.\nYes, the painting boldly depicts George Washington sitting in the heavens in an exalted manner; or in literal terms, ascending and becoming a god (apotheosis).\nWANT TO SEE IT? Click here.\nGeorge Washington is allegorically represented as being surrounded by figures from classical mythology. Washington is draped in purple, a royal color, with a rainbow arch at his feet, flanked by the goddess Victoria (draped in green, using a horn) to his left and the Goddess of Liberty to his right.\nSurrounding Washington, the two goddesses and the 13 maidens are six scenes lining the perimeter, each representing a national concept allegorically: from directly below Washington in the center and moving clockwise:\n\n\u201cWar\u201d\n\u201cScience\u201d\n\u201cMarine\u201d\n\u201cCommerce\u201d\n\u201cMechanics\u201d\n\u201cAgriculture\u201d\n\n\n\nThe six scenes depict the following:\nWAR\nFreedom, also known as Columbia, is directly below Washington in the personification of War. The scene depicts a woman fighting for liberty with a raised sword, a cape, and a helmet and shield (in the colors of the American flag) trampling figures representing Tyranny and Kingly Power. To Freedom\u2019s left assisting her is a fierce bald eagle (the national bird of the United States) carrying arrows and a thunderbolt (reminiscent of the arrows carried by the eagle in the Great Seal of the United States).\n\n\nSCIENCE\nMinerva, the Roman goddess of crafts and wisdom, is portrayed with helmet and spear pointing to an electrical generator creating power stored in batteries next to a printing press, representing great American inventions. American scientists and inventors Benjamin Franklin, Samuel F. B. Morse, and Robert Fulton watch. In the left part of the scene, a teacher demonstrates the use of dividers.\nMARINE\nThis scene shows Neptune, the Roman sea-god, with trident and crown of seaweed riding in a shell chariot drawn by sea horses. Venus, goddess of love born from the sea, is depicted helping to lay the transatlantic telegraph cable which ran from America to the Telegraph Field in Ireland.[2] In the background is an ironclad warship with smokestacks.\n\n\nCOMMERCE\nMercury, the Roman god of commerce, with his winged petasos and sandals and a caduceus, is depicted giving a bag of gold to American Revolutionary War financier Robert Morris. To the left, men move a box on a dolly; on the right, the anchor and sailors lead into \u201cMarine.\u201d\nMECHANICS\nVulcan, the Roman god of fire and the forge, is depicted standing at an anvil with his foot on a cannon next to a pile of cannonballs. A steam engine is in the background. The man at the forge is thought to represent Charles Thomas, the supervisor of ironwork during the construction of the Capitol dome.\nAGRICULTURE\nCeres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, is shown with a wreath of wheat and a cornucopia, a symbol of plenty, while sitting on a McCormick mechanical reaper. The personification of Young America in a liberty cap holds the reins of the horses, while the goddess Flora gathers flowers in the foreground.\nIs this the sort of thing any Christian nation would approve of? Can you imagine posting this in your church? Can you imagine Jesus approving of this?\nSpeaking of which: Where is Jesus in this painting? Where is the One True God? Why are Roman gods and goddesses depicted alongside George Washington as if he were equal to them?\n\n\nDoes this disturb you?\nI\u2019d love to know your thoughts about it.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and is co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour podcast.

205,10 Reasons To Stop Tithing,"January 15, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\nHere are 10 very good reasons to stop tithing your 10% every week:\n\nThe command to tithe was given only to the Jewish people. It was intended to provide for the upkeep of the Temple in Jerusalem and to support the Priesthood who owned no land and did not work to support themselves.\n\n\nThe Temple in Jerusalem is gone now and has been for over 2,000 years, since its destruction by the Romans in AD 70.\nThere is no longer any need to support a priesthood made up of people who do not own land or work for a living.\nThe Old Covenant is now obsolete according to Hebrews 8:13. Therefore no one needs to keep those laws anymore.\nIf you are in Christ then you are now the Temple of God where He has made His home. [See 1 Cor. 6:19-20]\nThose who abide in Christ are automatically ordained into the Priesthood of All Believers. [See 1 Peter 2:4-5 and 2:9-10]\nThe daily sacrifice that was once offered in the Jewish Temple is now replaced by the living, daily sacrifice of every member of Christ\u2019s Body. [See Romans 12:1]\nThe New Testament scriptures do not command anyone to tithe and the Church didn\u2019t formally institute the tithe until 777 AD under Charlemagne. For over 700 years no one who followed Christ tithed anything to the church.\nThe New Covenant standard is not 10%, but 100%. God owns everything, and we are commanded to surrender everything to Christ.\xa0[See Luke 9:23 and Mark 12:17 ]\nThe early Christians only practiced a freewill offering, not a mandatory ten percent obligation.\n\n\n\n\xa0\nJust look at what Tertullian, a second century Christian, tells us about what the early Church did with their offerings:\n\n\n\u201cEven if there is a treasury of a sort, it is not made up of money paid in initiation fees, as if religion were a matter of contract. Every man once a month brings some modest contribution- or whatever he wishes, and only if he does wish, and if he can; for nobody is\xa0compelled; it is a voluntary offering\u2026to feed the poor and to bury them, for boys and\xa0girls who lack property and parents, and then for slaves grown old\u2026So we, who are united\xa0in mind and soul, have no hesitation about sharing property. All is common\xa0among us-\xa0except our wives. At that point, we dissolve our partnership..\u201d\n\nIN SUMMARY:\xa0\nNo Christian today should continue to follow the Old Covenant mandate given to pre-Christian Jews to surrender ten percent of their income to their religious leaders.\n\nNow that everyone who is in Christ has been named the Temple of God, and has become the daily, living sacrifice, and has been ordained into the Priesthood of God, there is no longer any need to pay tithes to upkeep a building or to support a separate group or class of religious leaders.\n\nUnder the New Covenant, God owns 100%. We are called to surrender all that we have to Christ and to follow Him with our whole life. Under this New Covenant, we do not relegate worship to one day a week, but we now seek and serve and worship Him every single day of our lives.\nSo, stop holding back from God. Give 100 percent of your time, your money, your talent, and your life to Him.\n\n\nStop following rules and begin to follow the voice of the Spirit of God that lives within you.\n\nGive freely, because you have freely received. [Matt. 10:8]\n\u201cEach of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.\u201d [2 Cor. 9:7]\n\xa0\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour podcast.

206,Unbelievable Truth: God Really Loves You,"January 12, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\nGod\u2019s love for mankind is an incredible thing.\xa0The scriptures are replete with example after example of God\u2019s endless declarations of love for every single person on the planet. \nUsually, these statements are about nations, or about general populations of people, but Jesus goes even further with this idea and affirms that God actually loves each of us individually. \n\n\nThis is why Jesus urges us to call God our \u201cAbba\u201d or \u201cDaddy\u201d when we pray. It\u2019s why Jesus says that \u201cGod so loved the whole world\u201d (and that means you and me) that He sent Jesus to give us life and set us free.\nPaul the Apostle even encouraged all of us to meditate on God\u2019s incredible love:\n\u201cI pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord\u2019s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge\u2014that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.\u201d (Ephesians 3:17-19)\nGod\u2019s love is wider than we can imagine. It\u2019s longer than we can comprehend. It\u2019s higher than we can reach. It\u2019s deeper than we can fathom. God\u2019s love surpasses knowledge. This means it\u2019s more than just information. It\u2019s actually too great for us to wrap our minds around. It means that if you had all the knowledge in the Universe you\u2019d still not be capable of fully knowing God\u2019s amazing love for you.\nGod made you in His own image. Just think of how that makes Him feel every time He looks at you. [Genesis 1:27]\n\n\nHis thoughts about you are more numerous than all the grains of sand on all the beaches on this planet. He is actually thinking about you. Right now. [Psalm 139:17-18]\nGod is singing over you. Right now. Just try to imagine what His voice sounds like as He opens His mouth and sings a song of love about you. [Zeph. 3:17]\n\n\nGod loves you so much that He would rather die than live without you. How amazing is that? [John 3:16]\nThe only thing more amazing than God\u2019s awesome love is this: The fact that you and I can take it for granted, or not fully receive it.\nMost Christians don\u2019t really go through their lives with the awareness of God\u2019s astounding love in their hearts. Instead, they walk around looking tired, or feeling empty, or stressed out; totally oblivious to the endless showers of love that God is pouring down over them night and day.\nI think I understand\xa0why\xa0we don\u2019t believe that God loves us like this. It\u2019s because deep down inside we\u2019re convinced that we don\u2019t deserve that kind of love, and certainly not from someone as Holy and Perfect as God.\nBut that\u2019s the whole point of God\u2019s love: It\u2019s ours, and we have it now, and nothing can ever change that.\n\n\nIf you have children of your own, you can understand this. No matter what mistakes your child makes, you will always love them. No matter what awful things they do, you will still call them your son or daughter. Your love is not conditional on their performance, or lack thereof.\nGod looks at you and His heart is full of love. He loves to hear your voice. He loves to know our thoughts. He longs to reveal more of Himself to you.\nGod is love, and His love endures forever.\nNow, just imagine if Christians really did believe that God loved them? Wouldn\u2019t they be happier? Wouldn\u2019t this love fill them up and spill out of them like light from under a basket?\nWouldn\u2019t this love make it easier to forgive those who hurt us most?\nWouldn\u2019t a greater awareness of God\u2019s unconditional, endless, boundless and fantastic love change us forever? Wouldn\u2019t this love help us to love others more?\nI do believe so. But, there\u2019s only one way to find out.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He\u2019s also the co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast and lives in Orange, CA with his wife and two adult sons.\n\n\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/01/unbelievable-truth-god-really-loves/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
207,Here\u2019s Why We Keep Having Arguments Online,"January 10, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\nWhenever we look out at the world, everything registers on our retina except for one area known as the blind spot. When it comes to perceiving reality, the biggest and most common blind spot is our self.\n\u201cEver notice how everyone who drives slower than you is an idiot and everyone who drives faster than you is a maniac?\u201d\xa0\u2013 George Carlin\nThis little observation perfectly describes the blind spot that almost everyone suffers from. Those who agree with us are rational, intelligent and possibly even genius-level savants, but those who disagree with us are morons, buffoons and sheeple.\n\n\n\xa0\nImage: Pixabay\nThis phenomenon \u2013 known as \u201cNa\xefve Realism\u201d \u2013 was observed and categorized by two scientists, Lee Ross and Andrew Ward, back in 1995. They concluded that since most people believe that their ideas and opinions have only been arrived at after careful and thoughtful study, [which isn\u2019t usually true], we then falsely assume that a simple statement of facts which support our position will \u201cfix\u201d anyone who disagrees with us. When it doesn\u2019t work we then assume that these people must be idiots, blinded by their worldview, brain-washed, or possibly even subversive agents who oppose \u201cThe Truth\u201d, [which is also usually not true either].\nEssentially, we all fail to recognize our own biases and, at the same time, are acutely aware of everyone else\u2019s biases.\nJesus called it having a log in the eye.\nNaive Realism has three tenets:\nOne: You tend to believe that you arrived at your opinions after careful, rational analysis.\n\n\nTwo: Since you are devoted to sticking to the facts, this must mean that you are free from bias. Anyone who reads what you have read or experienced the same things you have will naturally see things your way.\nThree: If anyone disagrees with your opinions it must be because they simply don\u2019t have all the facts yet.\nSimply put, this is why we have so many arguments on Facebook.\nIt goes something like this:\nYou read something and disagree with it.\nThe other person cuts and pastes from their sources to prove you wrong or to defend their logic.\nYou cut and paste, or quote from, your favorite sources to advance your unbiased perspective.\nThey ignore that and post links to other sources that should convince you \u2013 if you were rational and unbiased as they are \u2013 and when it doesn\u2019t convince you they begin to go down their list of reasons why you must be so blind \u2013 you\u2019re stupid, you\u2019re brain-washed, you\u2019re lazy, etc.\nEventually, someone gets un-friended or blocked.\nPost. Argue. Repeat.\n\nThe problem comes when we assume that we see the world objectively, as it truly is. Therefore, we assume that those who see it otherwise are not simply seeing it\xa0differently,\xa0they are seeing it\xa0incorrectly.\n\n\nWe are right. They are wrong. That\u2019s all there is to it.\n\n\nBut that isn\u2019t reality.\nSee, none of us is without bias. Not you. Not them. Not even me. We all believe that our beliefs are the right beliefs \u2013 otherwise, we\u2019d believe something else. But if we\u2019re honest, we are much more critical of other people\u2019s arguments than we are of our own. Which is what a recent study discovered.\nIn the experiment conducted by Professor Lee Ross, University students were asked if they would be willing to walk around campus wearing a large wooden sign. About half of them agreed to do so. When asked to guess about how many others might also choose to wear the sign, or not wear the sign, both groups guessed that \u201ca majority\u201d of other students must have decided to do as they had done. [Actual results were 50/50].\nThen, they asked both groups this question:\n\n\n\u201cFor those who chose differently than you did, what do you think their choices reveal about them?\u201d\xa0\n\n\nIn each case, students said that those who chose not to do as they had done were probably fearful, foolish, or otherwise abnormal. However, when asked what their own choices revealed about themselves, every student felt that their decisions revealed nothing about them; because they had simply made the \u201cnormal\u201d choice that any rational person would have made.\n\n\n\n\nOr, in other words, those who drive faster than me are maniacs and those who drive slower than me are idiots, but those who drive the same way I do are normal, rational and wonderful human beings.\nSo, now that we\u2019re aware that we all do this, what can we do to mitigate against it?\nWell, mainly it means that we have to recognize that we are not perfect. We are capable of being wrong. We all have our own inner bias, and we need to have grace for others who also have their own set of biases.\nIn our house church family, we\u2019ve come to the same conclusions through other methods, but the essential concept is the same:\xa0We\u2019re all in process.\nBecause we all recognize that we are in process, along with everyone else, we tend to have grace for one another, especially for those who don\u2019t happen to see things the way we currently see them \u2013 because not so long ago we saw things in a totally different way than we do now.\nThis also means that we are less focused on trying to get others to see things our way and more focused on allowing Jesus to transform us into His image.\nIn other words, we seek a consensus of heart \u2013 which is about how we put the words of Jesus into practice \u2013 and we\u2019re not seeking a consensus of opinion \u2013 which is about getting everyone to conform to a set of doctrines and beliefs.\n\n\nIn fact, we actually value the ability to fellowship with those who see things differently. How else can we learn if we only associate with those who already agree with us?\nThis works beautifully, as long as none of us decides to impose our views on everyone else. As long as we can all hold loosely to our ideas and adopt a posture that says, \u201cI might be wrong\u201d, or \u201cI have something to learn from the rest of you\u201d, we\u2019re in good shape. It\u2019s only when someone demands conformity that we\u2019re in trouble.\nThis \u201cNaive Realism\u201d phenomenon exposes our inherent narcissism. We all have a version of reality that places ourselves in the center and elevates our ideas as the standard to which everyone else should conform.\nIf everyone who drives slower than me is too slow, and if everyone who is faster than me is too fast, then only those who are doing what I am doing \u2013 or thinking like I am thinking \u2013 are in the right. This means that only those who are like me are worth listening to and those who aren\u2019t like me are inferior.\nDoes that sound like a way of thinking that Jesus would advocate?\nCertainly not.\nBut it does illustrate why Jesus commanded his disciples and followers to do one thing right off the bat:\xa0Deny yourself and follow me.\n\n\nJesus knows that men and women are selfish at heart. He completely sees how we all live in our own little universe \u2013 or kingdom \u2013 where we are at the center and everything is oriented to conform to our way of thinking.\nInstead, Jesus says that we have to put Him at the center of our lives and we must conform our way of thinking to His. This is what he means when he says, \u201crepent\u201d, which means \u201cto think differently.\u201d\nSo, what\u2019s our only way out of this trap of self-deception? \n\n\nI think we have to let go of the idea that we are the unbiased standards for excellence. We have to surrender ourselves to Jesus, allowing Him to be our center and our standard. We can\u2019t lean on our own understanding. We must orient ourselves towards Jesus and allow Him to guide our thoughts, and actions, and attitudes.\nAs one friend pointed out to me, Jesus said \u201cFollow me and I will make you\u2026\u201d, which means transformation is built into the deal.\nWe have to admit that we need to change, and then we have to confess that we cannot change ourselves apart from Jesus. He makes us into the people we need to be; conformed to His image and filled with His Spirit which is brimming with love, and life and hope and peace that passes understanding.\n\n\nPut Jesus at the center and then let go of that steering wheel. You\u2019ll like where He wants to take you.\nI promise.\n-kg\n\n\n**\nNOTE:\xa0This blog post was inspired by an \xa0interview with Lee Ross by David McRaney over on the\xa0\u201cYou Are Not So Smart\u201d\xa0podcast.\nListen\xa0HERE>\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

208,The New Jerusalem Scandal,"January 9, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\nIn 70 AD, the city of Jerusalem was surrounded by the Roman army. After many days of intense battle, the Romans broke down the gates, swarmed through the city and slaughtered men, women, and children. It was, according to the historian Josephus (who was an eyewitness to the entire bloody event) one of the most horrific displays of violence the world had ever seen.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a short excerpt from Josephus\u2019s account:\n\u201c\u2026As they [Roman soldiers] drew closer to the Temple, they pretended not even to hear Caesar\u2019s orders, but urged the men in front to throw in more firebrands.\xa0\n\u201cMost of the slain were peaceful citizens, weak and unarmed, and they were butchered where they were caught. The heap of corpses mounted higher and higher about the altar; a stream of blood flowed down the Temple\u2019s steps, and the bodies of those slain at the top slipped to the bottom.\n\u201cWhile the Temple was ablaze, the attackers plundered it, and countless people who were caught by them were slaughtered. There was no pity for age and no regard was accorded rank; children and old men, laymen and priests, alike were butchered; every class was pursued and crushed in the grip of war, whether they cried out for mercy or offered resistance.\n\u201cThrough the roar of the flames streaming far and wide, the groans of the falling victims were heard; such was the height of the hill and the magnitude of the blazing pile that the entire city seemed to be ablaze; and the noise \u2013 nothing more deafening and frightening could be imagined.\n\n\n\u201cThe Temple Mount, everywhere enveloped in flames, seemed to be boiling over from its base; yet the blood seemed more abundant than the flames and the numbers of the slain greater than those of the slayers. The soldiers climbed over heaps of bodies as they chased the fugitives.\u201d\n\xa0References:\xa0\xa0Josephus\u2018 account appears in: Cornfield, Gaalya ed.,\xa0Josephus, The Jewish War (1982); Duruy, Victor, History of Rome vol. V (1883).\n\xa0With all of this fresh in my mind, I re-read Revelation Chapter 21 and 22 where John describes the New Jerusalem for us and I realized something so profound: Everything John tells us about the New Jerusalem is an inversion of what happened to the Old Jerusalem.\nIn John\u2019s description of the New Jerusalem, the enemies of Christ are outside the walls of the city, but there are no gates for them to tear down. Instead, we are told that the gates of the New Jerusalem \u201cwill never be shut.\u201d [v.25]\n\n\nAlso, in the center of the New Jerusalem, John tells us \u201cI saw no temple in the city, for the temple is the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb\u201d [v.22]. Instead of those Nations [who are the enemies of Christ] bringing death into the City to destroy the temple, they are welcomed into the City by the Temple Himself to receive healing and life as Jesus calls out to them saying, \u201cTo the thirsty I will give to drink from the spring of the water of life without payment.\u201d [v.6]\nWhereas the Armies of Rome broke down the gates to burn down the Temple and spread death in the Old Jerusalem, in the New Jerusalem the Armies outside the City find the gates wide open, and they are offered waters of life to drink, and abundant life is freely given to them; even the trees that grow along the river \u201care for the healing of the Nations\u201d [Rev. 22:2]\nThen I noticed the significance of this verse and saw it as if for the first time:\n\u201cThe Spirit and\xa0the Bride say, \u201cCome.\u201d And let the one who hears say, \u201cCome.\u201d And\xa0let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the\xa0water of life without price.\u201d [Rev. 22:17]\n\n\n \n\nTo whom are the Spirit and the Bride saying \u201cCome\u201d? I used to think we were calling out to Jesus to \u201cCome quickly!\u201d and rapture all of us to this New Jerusalem. But I don\u2019t think this makes sense in context. [That comes later in the chapter]. Notice that after that it says: \u201cAnd let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.\u201d\nWho would that be? Not Jesus. But those outside the city gates, who are in torment, \u201cthose who hear\u201d and \u201cthose who are thirsty\u201d are being wooed by the Spirit and the Bride to come and \u201ctake the water of life without price.\u201d\nAll of his made me ask: \u201cWhat if this picture of the New Jerusalem isn\u2019t meant to tell us about an actual future event after the end of time?\u201d I wondered, \u201cWhat if this picture of New Jerusalem is intended to redeem the horrific destruction of Old Jerusalem?\u201d\nWhat if this is really the entire point that John is trying to make? That God\u2019s intention is to subvert all the violence of AD 70 and, in Christ, to reframe the dark violence against Old Jerusalem as a triumphant display of mercy and grace in the New Jerusalem?\n\n\nIsn\u2019t this also a picture of what Christ did on the cross? Isn\u2019t this also how Christ absorbed all the violence of the Roman crucifixion \u2013\xa0 which was intended to bring great shame upon the victims \u2013 and redirected all of it to shame the principalities and powers?\nAs Paul phrases it: \u201c[God ] disarmed the rulers and authorities and\xa0put them to open shame, by\xa0triumphing over them in [Christ].\u201d (Col. 2:15)\nThey sought to shame Christ by nailing Him to a cross, but instead, Christ disarms them and exposes them to shame, but then He does something even more marvelous \u2013 He forgives their sin and absolves them of murder saying, \u201cFather, forgive them. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nI think this is exactly what John wants us to see in Revelation 21 and 22. The Romans, whose armies were made up of people from every tongue, and tribe and nation that their Empire had conquered, surrounded the Old Jerusalem, broke down the walls, torched the Temple and exhaled violence and death upon everyone in that city.\n\n\nNow, Christ has established a New Jerusalem, and when His enemies \u2013 made of people from every tongue and tribe \u2013 come to storm the gates and destroy the Temple, they find the gates wide open, and instead of a Temple they see a Lamb standing in the center of the City inviting them to drink freely from the waters of life, and to receive healing for their wounds.\nIn the New Jerusalem, there is not death, but life; not destruction, but healing; not vengeance but forgiveness; not darkness but light.\nDo you know another name for this New Jerusalem? John also says that it is called \u201cThe Bride of Christ.\u201d [Rev. 21: 9-10]\nAnd who is the Bride of Christ? We are the Bride of Christ.\nSo, this is our mission. This is our story. This is who we are.\n\u201cLet the Spirit and the Bride say \u2018Come!'\u201d to those outside the city walls who are thirsty for the waters of life.\nCome, drink deep. It\u2019s on the house.\n-kg\n\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/01/new-jerusalem-scandal/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
209,Is It A Sin To Be Gay?,"January 6, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\n\u201cSo, is it ok to be gay and Christian?\u201d\nI think that\u2019s a very good question. I will do my best to provide an answer.\nImage: Pixabay\nFirst of all, I\u2019ve been studying this topic for over a year now. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve held off writing about until I was quite certain I could speak about it with integrity.\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed this blog for any length of time you already know that I\u2019m no stranger to controversy. But this topic, unlike any other, is more volatile than anything I\u2019ve ever written about before.\nI\u2019ve lost friends and relationships with other Christians over issues like hierarchy in the Church, the Priesthood of All Believers, Christian Non-Violence and the different views of Hell, to name a few.\nBut taking a position on the issue of Homosexuality has the potential to damage many relationships that I hold most dear, including members of our family.\nAt one point I nearly backed off completely. But then I felt I heard the Holy Spirit remind me that my calling is not to minimize my own suffering but to help alleviate the suffering of others.\nSo, here we go.\nAt one time I took the words of Paul at face value, especially when it came to verses where he forbids a woman to teach, or when he condemns homosexual activity.\nBut then something happened. First, my friend Jon Zens wrote a book called \u201cWhat\u2019s With Paul and Women?\u201d which went directly to those passages where it appeared that Paul was clearly against women teaching men, or even speaking out loud in the assembly, and exposed our bad English translations, our lack of understanding the culture of that day, and years of bias against the subject matter.\n\n\nWhat emerged was a better understanding of what Paul was actually saying, and better yet, WHY he was saying it.\nFor me, the topic of homosexuality has taken a similar path. As I\u2019ve gone back to re-examine those passages where Paul certainly appears to condemn homosexuality I\u2019ve begun to notice almost exactly the same pattern as what emerged in the issue of women in church leadership: The Greek words usually translated by our modern Bibles as \u201cHomosexuals\u201d don\u2019t actually correlate to what we would call homosexuality today; There is a cultural phenomenon at work that most never incorporate; and there is a bias against homosexuality that is quite apparent once you consider all the perspectives that have been intentionally silenced over the years.\nI\u2019ll do my best to unpack all of that for you here.\nFor the record: I am not gay. No one in my immediate family is gay. I am not taking a stand against the traditional view of homosexuality based on any emotional imperative or personal agenda.\nOn the contrary, I am laying my head on this chopping block because I believe that the Christian church has used these few verses as a weapon to marginalize and condemn an entire group of people who should be welcomed into the Body of Christ as brothers and sisters.\n\n\nI know I will take the hit for saying this. I\u2019m saying it anyway. And I hope to back it up with some very solid Biblical exegesis and relevant insight.\nBack to our friend\u2019s question: \u201cSo, is it ok to be gay and Christian?\u201d\nI would say that, if you define being \u201cgay\u201d as having a same-sex attraction [and only an attraction, not moving further into lust or fornication], then yes, it is ok to be a Christian who is attracted to someone of the same sex.\nHow can I say this?\nBecause being attracted to someone, in itself, isn\u2019t a sin. The Bible never suggests anything otherwise.\nI know that some take the words of Jesus about \u201clooking at a woman to lust after her\u201d as being equal to adultery, but what Jesus was referring to was exactly what he said: lustful thoughts, not default attractions, are equal to adultery.\nIn other words: We\u2019ve not committed the sin when we simply experience an attraction to another person. We sin when we allow our lusts to take over and our thoughts become carnal and/or we act on those lustful desires and physically engage in fornication.\n\n\nBut what about those verses you mentioned where Paul seems to very clearly condemn homosexuals?\nLet\u2019s take a look at those now.\nStarting with Roman chapter 1, let\u2019s look at what Paul has to say:\n\xa0\u201cTherefore\xa0God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be\xa0dishonored among them.\xa0For they exchanged the truth of God for\xa0a\xa0lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator\u2026For this reason\xa0God gave them over to\xa0degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is\xa0unnatural,\xa0and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another,\xa0men with men committing\xa0indecent acts and receiving in\xa0their own persons the due penalty of their error. And just as they did not see fit\xa0to acknowledge God any longer,\xa0God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper\u2026\u201d\xa0[Romans 1:24-28]\nHonestly, I don\u2019t believe there is any reason to believe that what Paul is describing here is analogous to what we would refer to as homosexuality today.\n\n\nThere are plenty of others who agree with me on this. For example, first century Christian,\xa0 Aristides and second century Christian apologist, Justin Martyr.\nAristides, who lived just 70 years after the Apostle Paul, taught that the issue Paul was addressing in Romans 1 was idolatry and sexual worship of false gods. In the second century, Justin Martyr also affirmed this interpretation of the passage.\nThose aren\u2019t exactly \u201cliberal\u201d Christian sources. These brothers aren\u2019t alone, either. People like Bible Commentary expert Matthew Henry, Scottish evangelist Robert Haldane, and orthodox Calvinist, Charles Hodge also agree that what Paul is referring to in Romans 1 is a condemnation of pagan sexual temple practices of prostitution.\nSee for yourself:\n\u201cIn Isaiah\u2019s time it (idolatry) abounded, witness the abominable idolatries of Ahaz (which some think are particularly referred to here \u2013 Isaiah 57) and of Manasseh. They were dotingly fond of their idols, were inflamed with them, as those that burn in unlawful unnatural lusts [Romans 1:27]. They were\xa0mad upon their idols [Jeremiah 50:38]. They inflamed themselves with them by\xa0their violent passions in the worship of them, as those of Baal\u2019s prophets that leaped upon the altar, and cut themselves [1 Kings 18:26,28]. Justly therefore were they\xa0given up to their own hearts\u2019 lusts.\u201d\xa0\u2013 Matthew Henry\xa0[From Matthew Henry\u2019s Complete Commentary on the Bible, Isaiah 57]\n\n\n\u201cThe reasons why Paul refers in the first instance to the sins of\xa0uncleanness,\xa0in illustration and proof of the degradation of the heathen, probably were, that those sins are always intimately connected with idolatry, forming at times even a part of the service rendered to the false gods.\u201d\xa0\u2013 Charles Hodge\xa0[From \u201cA Commentary on Romans\u201d,\xa0by Charles Hodge, 1983 reprint (first published in 1835), Banner of Truth Trust, Carlisle, PA, p. 41.]\n\u201cThe Apostle having awfully depicted the magnitude of Pagan wickedness, and having shown that their ungodliness in abandoning the worship of the true God was the reason why they had been abandoned to their lusts, here descends into particulars, for the purpose of showing to what horrible excesses God had permitted them to proceed.\n\u201cThis was necessary, to prove how odious in the sight of God is the crime of idolatry. Its recompense was this fearful abandonment. It was also necessary, in order to give a just idea of human corruption, as evinced in its monstrous enormities when allowed to take its course, and also in order to exhibit to believers a living proof of the depth of the evil from which God had delivered them; and, finally, to prove the falsity of the Pagan religion since, so far from preventing such excesses, it even incited and conducted men to their commission.\u201d\xa0\u2013 Robert Haldane\xa0[From \u201cCommentary on Romans\u201d by Robert Haldane, 1835.]\n\n\nIf you doubt this assessment, I invite you to go back and to re-read Romans chapter one, from the beginning. What you\u2019ll observe is a progression in Paul\u2019s argument that begins with a condemnation of pagan idol worship and ends with a description of what that worship involves and how God punishes those who engage in the practice.\nSo, as I began to look at this passage again, I started to wonder if what Paul was focused on here was anything at all like what we would refer to as homosexuality today.\nNow let\u2019s look at 1 Corinthians 6. This is where things get a lot more interesting.\n\u201cOr do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality.\u201d\xa0 [1 Cor. 6:9,\xa0ESV]\n\n\nThis seems pretty much a slam-dunk, doesn\u2019t it? How can we argue with this? Well, once you start to examine the Greek you\u2019ll begin to see a few problems.\nFirst, the word translated here as \u201chomosexuals\u201d is from the Greek word \u201carseno-koitai\u201d. This is a word that most NT scholars would say Paul invented. In other words, we don\u2019t exactly know what it means because it\u2019s a compound word made out of two different Greek words which are forced together. Paul never explains or defines this word for us. It literally means \u201cMan\u201d and \u201cTo Bed\u201d which our \xa0modern English NT translators have wrongly rendered as \u201chomosexuals\u201d.\n\n\nThat term first appeared in our modern English translations in the Revised Standard Version of the Bible back in 1946.\nBibles translated earlier than 1946 render the verse like this:\n\u201cKnow ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor\xa0effeminate\xa0(malakoi),\xa0nor abusers of themselves with mankind,\xa0(arsenokoites)\u201d\xa0[1 Cor 6:9, KJV]\nAs you can see above, the King James Version did not contain the word \u201chomosexuals\u201d. Only later translations and editions changed the word to \u201chomosexuals\u201d\nKeep in mind that this shift in the translation came not from better, more convincing scholarship, but from cultural shifts within the Christian church.\nLet\u2019s look at these two words in a little more detail.\n\n\nThe Greek word\xa0\u201cmalakoi\u201d,\xa0which is the plural of malakos, and the Greek word\xa0\u201carseno-koitai\u201d\xa0are both used in 1 Cor 6:9.\nFirst we\u2019ll examine the word \u201cArseno-koitai\u201d. As we said, many New Testament scholars have argued that Paul invented the compound word himself, since it cannot be found in any other writings of the time to refer to same-sex attraction or relationships.\nThere were over a dozen other words which Paul could have used if what he wanted to refer to was your everyday, ordinary homosexuality. I won\u2019t go into the list of words, but there are plenty of other terms for same-sex intercourse in the Greek language that Paul left out of his epistle.\nWhy did he do that? We don\u2019t know. But for whatever reason, Paul instead, chose to use an unfamiliar compound word\xa0 \u2013 \u201carseno-koitai\u201d \u2013 which is never used in any extant Greek literature with our modern meaning of homosexual.\n\u201cArseno-koitai\u201d is used only once more in the Bible, [1 Timothy 1:10], and Paul never defines its meaning for us.\n\n\nAre you ready for a big surprise? This next detail might just resolve the mystery of Paul\u2019s invented word for us.\nThere was a very well-respected Jewish teacher who lived during the lifetime of both Jesus and Paul the Apostle. His name was Philo.\xa0 He was one of the most widely read Jewish intellectuals in the first century.\nIt\u2019s no secret that Paul was highly educated as a Pharisee under Gamaliel. We know because of the works he quoted that Paul also read other philosophers and thinkers of his day. He most certainly would have been well-versed with someone like Philo who, no doubt, held great influence over the Pharisees and Rabbis living in first century Jerusalem.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s most fascinating about Philo. In his commentary on Leviticus 18:22, he argues that what Moses was condemning was shrine prostitution, and he specifically used the term \u201carseno-koitai\u201d.\nWait. What?\nThat\u2019s right. It seems that Paul did not invent this compound word. Philo did. And when Philo used the term, he used it to refer to the practice of pagan temple prostitution.\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the other word that Paul uses in 1 Cor. 6, \u201cMalakoi\u201d.\nThe word \u201cmalakoi\u201d\xa0occurs four times, in three verses in the New Testament. In Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25, Jesus uses the word to refer to\xa0soft\xa0clothing. Jesus never used the word in reference to homosexuality.\nThe best translation of the word into English is \u201ceffeminate\u201d, not \u201chomosexual\u201d.\n\xa0In the first century, this term is normally used as an epithet against heterosexual men. As in, \u201cYou punch like a girl\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t cry like a girl\u201d.\xa0 The word is never used to refer to someone who is homosexual. It is always used to describe a heterosexual male whose behavior is more feminine, or soft, than male.\n\xa0Plato, for example, in his \u201cRepublic\u201d,\xa0wrote famously that too much music made a man\xa0soft [malakoi],\xa0and feeble; unfit for battle.\xa0He did not argue that it made him a\xa0homosexual.\n\xa0Aristotle also warned about the dangers of men becoming too soft [malakoi] by over-indulging in pleasures rather than balancing out their lives with acts of physical and mental discipline. Again, he was also not saying that lack of exercise or hard work might make someone turn gay.\n\n\nEven Josephus, the first-century Jewish historian [and contemporary of Jesus and Paul] used the term \u201cmalakos\u201d to describe men who were weak and soft through lack of courage in battle. [See \u201cWars of The Jews\u201d, 7:338;\xa0and \u201cAntiquities of The Jews\u201d,\xa05:246; 10:194.]\nWant to know what\u2019 even more interesting about how first century people understood this term? It turns out that \u201cmalakoi\u201d was most often used in reference to men who shaved daily and had no beards. These were often ridiculed and accused of wanting to look like women with clean-shaven faces.\nIf this is what Paul had in mind in 1 Cor. 6:9, then the reference is more about cultural norms of the day \u2013 which is similar to what Paul writes about when he condemns short hair on women and long hair on men and calls this \u201cunnatural\u201d or \u201cagainst nature\u201d.\n\u201cDoth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.\u201d\xa0[1 Cor. 11:14-16]\nIs a man with a clean-shaven face an abomination before God? Is he going against his own nature? Or is this an example of First Century cultural norms being equated with God\u2019s eternal purpose?\nI think these are worthwhile questions to explore. I also think that the conclusions that many Christians have accepted today are seriously lacking in the necessary study and critical thinking required to justify many of our attitudes towards those with same-sex attractions.\nIf this were a court of law, I believe that the evidence above is certainly enough to warrant a reasonable doubt about the true meaning of these passages we often use to condemn people who are not like us.\nAs I said before, I think this topic is very similar to doctrines like Hell and Women in Ministry. At one time you and I might have read the scriptures and said, \u201cIt says right here\u2026\u201d without knowing that what we were reading was:\n\nA) Not exactly what was said in the actual Greek\nB) Lacking historical background information regarding the culture of those people and\nC) Unduly influenced by NT translators who had a bias towards the subject matter\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, here\u2019s what I\u2019m saying \u2013 People who experience a same-sex attraction are not condemned by God. Many of them are our brothers and sisters in Christ. They should be embraced and welcome into the Body of Christ, regardless of who they feel any attraction to. In fact, their attraction to Christ as Lord and Savior is the only one we should take into consideration at all.\nHopefully, we could all agree that as ambassadors of Christ we need to love homosexuals and share the love of Jesus with them rather than attack and condemn them.\nMaybe you don\u2019t agree? I don\u2019t know. But for me the Christian\u2019s job is to share and show the love of Jesus to everyone \u2013 regardless of their struggle with sin \u2013 and allow the Holy Spirit to A) Convict people of their sins and B) Transform them into the image of Christ. Neither of those is the job of the Christian, and therefore, not my job either.\nFor the record: Being gay is not a sin. Being attracted to someone of the same sex is not sinful.\nChristians need to stop assuming that someone who identifies as Gay or as LGBTQ is any more a sinner than they are \u2013 because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, remember?\n\n\nIt\u2019s time for Christians to accept one another without judgment or reservation.\nThanks for taking the time to wrestle through this with me.\nPeace,\nKeith\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d\n\xa0\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/01/is-it-a-sin-to-be-gay/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
210,What Is Sound Doctrine?,"January 5, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard teachers and preachers talk about the need for \u201csound doctrine\u201d in today\u2019s church. Usually, this \u201csound doctrine\u201d happens to mirror a denominational statement of faith ratified years ago and enforced by church leadership, (deacons, elders, etc.), and reinforced through church membership classes and sometimes even Sunday School classes.\nBut, what is \u201csound doctrine\u201d according to the Word of God? Shouldn\u2019t we take whatever standards there may be for \u201csound doctrine\u201d from the Scriptures themselves?\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what Paul had to say about \u201csound doctrine\u201d when he wrote to the apostle, Titus:\n\u201cYou, (Titus) however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine.\u201d \u2013 Titus 2:1\nSee? Obviously Paul knew that it was very important to teach sound doctrine in the Church. Luckily for us, Paul breaks down the elements of this sound doctrine for us here:\n\u201cTeach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance. Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.\u201d \u2013 Titus 2:2-5\nWait. So, let me get this straight. Paul says that sound doctrine is all about being self-controlled, loving, patient and full of faith? Huh. I was expecting more like rules and laws and stuff. Wait, let\u2019s see what he says after this part. Maybe the rules and laws come later:\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.\u201d- Titus 2:6-8\nOk. So, sound doctrine seems to be more about how we live our lives before one another. It\u2019s like, setting examples for one another by doing good, showing integrity, speaking truthfully, living a simple, decent life before men. That\u2019s\u2026.shocking. So is the next part:\n\u201cTeach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.\u201d \u2013 Titus 2:9-11\nOk, then. So, slaves should continue to serve their masters in humility, show that they can be fully trusted and in so doing, \u201cthey will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.\u201d Wow. Paul\u2019s goal here seems to be more about living out a sincere, authentic faith before the world than in any personal piety or in following rules and laws. Maybe he gets to the part about infant baptism or the pre-millenial kingdom in this last part? Let\u2019s see:\n\n\n\u201cFor the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say \u201cNo\u201d to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope\u2014the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.\u201d \u2013 Titus 2:11-14\nWhoa. Now Paul has started to jack up the whole idea of Grace too. Here he says that Grace teaches us to say \u201cNo\u201d to ungodliness and worldly passions. I thought Grace was there to give us a pass when we say \u201cYes\u201d to our worldly passions. Right? Hmm\u2026maybe not. Again, Paul seems to teach here that Grace empowers us to live out the Sound Doctrine of living self-controlled, upright and godly lives.\n\n\n\u201cThese, then, are the things you should teach.\u201d \u2013 Titus 2:15\nReally? Well\u2026.ok, then. Let\u2019s all start teaching \u201cSound Doctrine\u201d as Paul outlines it for us here. We are called to teach one another to live simple, humble, godly lives of service, love, compassion and integrity before one another and to the world around us. How? By the power of Grace that \u201cteaches us to say \u2018No\u2019 to ungodliness and worldly passions.\u201d\n\n\nIf our churches today would major on sound doctrine like this and not divide over stupid disagreements about the return of Christ, or over doctrines of tongues or the rapture, or predestination, or any other superficial topic, we might actually live out true sound doctrine as Paul describes.\nDisputes over doctrines come because we allow them to become more important to us than our unity in Christ.\nWhat is it makes us one? Christ! Not our agreements about infant baptism, or freewill, or pre-millenialism, or the King James Bible. None of that. The only thing that makes us one is Christ, and He is more than enough.\n-kg\n*MORE VERSES ON BEHAVIOR AS SOUND DOCTRINE:\n\u201cIf I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.\u201d (John 13:14-15 ESV)\n\u201cNow these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come.

It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate.\u201d (2 Thessalonians 3:7-9 ESV)\n\u201cBut I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life.\u201d (1 Timothy 1:16 ESV)\n\u201cLet no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.\u201d (1 Timothy 4:12 ESV)\n\n\n\u201cRemember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.\u201d (Hebrews 13:7 ESV)\n\u201cBeloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good.

211,"Focus On The Flame, Not The Burning Stick","January 3, 2018",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nFor a long time now I\u2019ve been very aware of my need to die to myself, take up my cross daily, and follow Jesus. It\u2019s the foundation for the Christian life, it\u2019s essential for discipleship, and it\u2019s the core of the Gospel message that Jesus came and died to bring us.\n\n\nBut lately, I\u2019ve been focused mostly on my side of this equation instead of on the entire process. Mainly, what I\u2019ve been missing is the perspective of the exchange that takes place.\nWhen I die to myself it\u2019s not merely a death of my will or pride, it\u2019s the catalyst for a chemical reaction whereby my life is lost so that the life of Christ can fill me up and replace my selfishness with his sacrificial love for others.\nWhat\u2019s been missing is the emphasis on the life of Christ being formed in me. This is what the phrase above, which God spoke to my heart last week, means: Focus on the flame (the power of Christ), not the burning stick (your death to self).\nWhat I need most is the life of Christ. I don\u2019t receive it by holding on to my life but by letting go of it.\nAfter thinking about this for a long time, I woke up one morning with this phrase in my head:\n\u201cFocus on the flame, not the burning stick.\u201d\nAt first I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, but the more I thought about this, the more I realized that it was exactly what I needed to hear. I was focusing too much on my death [the burning stick] and not on the new life that Christ wants to create within me.\n\n\nIf my focus is only on my own death, or weakness, I might end up missing the wonderful gift that comes from the chemical reaction.\nIn my spiritual life there should always be a constant exchange of energy, like an internal nuclear reactor inside of me. On one end it is burning up my flesh and bringing death to my flesh, but at the same time it is converting that death into the life of Christ within me. The exchange in me is one of constant death being traded in for eternal life. And what\u2019s more, the catalyst of this nuclear reaction is the resurrection power of Christ at work within me.\n\n\nPaul says it this way:\n\u201cWe always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus\u2019 sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body.\u201d \u2013 (2 Cor 4:10-12)\n\u201cTherefore we do not lose, though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.\u201d \u2013 (2 Corinthians 4:16-18)\n\n\n\xa0\nMy role is simply to surrender to Christ and allow Him to work both the crucifixion of my flesh and the resurrection life of Christ within me.\nMy prayer lately has been simply this: \u201cPlease Jesus come live and breathe in me today. Help me to embrace the death that the Gospel brings to my flesh so that I can experience the life of Christ that springs up from within by your Spirit.\u201d\nLet\u2019s not focus on our effort to die to ourselves. Instead, let\u2019s just experience the beautiful life of Christ that comes when we let go and trust in Jesus to transform us into people who are like Him.\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d\nHe is also the co-host of The Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2018/01/focus-flame-not-burning-stick/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
212,You Are God\u2019s Dream Come True,"December 29, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\nConsider this: God knows the end from the beginning. This means He can never have a new thought. Therefore, the idea of you was fully realized in God\u2019s heart and mind from eternity. Even before God said, \u201cLet there be light\u201d, you existed in His foreknowledge.\n\n\n**\nIf God was dreaming before the creation of the Universe, He was dreaming about you and me.\nPaul\xa0says that \u201cwe are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus.\u201d (See Eph..\xa02:10)\n**\nThis means that we are God\u2019s Masterpiece. We are the realization of those thoughts from before the world began.\n\n**\nBefore we were born, each of us was conceived in the heart of the Father. Now, we are the incarnation of that love made flesh.\n**\nSomeone once said that having a child is like having your heart walking around outside of your body. This is what we are like to God; we are God\u2019s heart walking around outside of Himself and moving around the world He created for us to inhabit.\n**\nHis posture towards us all is love. He is love and His love is now in us. He intends for us to fully receive this astounding love so that it can transform us and change us into people who, like Him, are radiating with an impossible love that has no end, no limit, and no conditions.\n\n\n**\nOr, to put it another way:\n**\n\u201cI pray that you may have the strength to grasp just how high, and wide, and long, and deep Christ\u2019s love is for you, and that you may know this love that transcends and surpasses human knowledge, so that you may be fully filled with all the fullness of God.\u201d (See Eph. 3:14-19)\n**\nThis incomprehensible love of God for us in Christ is unstoppable. Nothing can resist it. Nothing can stop it. Nothing can overcome it, or outlast it, or diminish this love in any way whatsoever.\n**\n\u201cCan anyone possibly separate any of us from the love of Christ? Could there be any trouble, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword capable of doing this?\xa0No. Not at all. In fact, in all these things we are more than overcomers through Him who loved us.\xa0For I am fully convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor any powers,\xa0nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all of creation, will ever be able to separate any of us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d (See Romans 8:35-39)\n\n\n**\nWe are loved. So perfectly and completely and eternally loved by God through Christ that even we cannot escape it, nullify it or disqualify ourselves from receiving it.\n**\nWe are all-too-quick\xa0to point out that none of us deserves this love, or that we are filthy sinners and wretched worms compared to Him. But you know who never points this out to us? God doesn\u2019t.\n**\nIn every verse in the New Testament where the astounding, transformative, life-changing love of God is mentioned, we are never told that we are worms who do not deserve it. Never. Not even once.\n\n\n**\nWe, in our own hearts, quickly distance ourselves from this extravagant love by wallowing in our unworthiness. But God never places any of that on us. He just loves us. He just continually reminds us that His love is greater than we can imagine and then He invites us to dive into the deep end and soak it all up.\n**\nWe are the ones who pencil in the margins of those chapters on His phenomenal love all the gory details of our sinfulness and wretchedness. But God doesn\u2019t do that. He just reiterates that His love is unending and unstoppable and then asks us to accept it as the truth.\n\n\n**\nLike it or not, we are loved. We are so very, very loved. It goes against everything we\u2019ve told to believe about ourselves, and about God, but it is true, nonetheless. We are the reason for the season. We are the objects of God\u2019s undying affection. He loves us like crazy. He thinks about us constantly. He rejoices over us with singing. He quiets us with His love. He would rather die a horrible, torturous death than to even consider living one moment apart from us. (See Zeph. 3:17; John 3:16)\n**\nHow can you not love a God like this? How can you not rejoice over a God who gives Himself away, over and over again, to declare to you that He has loved you with an everlasting love?\n**\nWe are God\u2019s dream come true. He literally died to demonstrate this remarkable love. All He asks is that we accept it, receive it, enjoy it, and then, go and shout this good news to everyone we meet: God is love, and He loves you more than you can possibly imagine, and you can know Him, and His mind-blowing love right now.\n\n\n**\nNow, do you see why it\u2019s so important that you and I first accept God\u2019s incredible love for us? Because until we have known and experienced this amazing love, we can\u2019t possibly share it with anyone else.\n**\nYour mission today is simply this: To grasp how long, and wide, and high and deep is this love of Christ for you; a love that transcends and surpasses human knowledge; a love that cannot ever be stopped or diminished in any way, by anyone, ever. Not even by you.\n**\nOnce you have started to fully receive this life-changing love of God, you can start radiating this love to everyone around you. Don\u2019t worry about giving it away freely. He will never stop pouring this love into you and through you, as long as you live, (and even after that).\n**\nBetter yet, He has promised to make His home in you and that He will never leave you, nor forsake you. So this means you and I will never know what it\u2019s like to live without Him. We will never know another moment apart from God. He will forever be as close to us as our own breath and as near to us as our own heartbeat from now through eternity. All we can ever experience is more of God and more of His love until one day we see Him face-to-face, and that\u2019s when things will get really exciting.\n\n\n**\nThis is good news, isn\u2019t it?\n**\nLet\u2019s spread it around.\n\n-kg\n\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He co-hosts the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast on iTunes and Podbean and lives in Orange, CA with his wife and two sons.\n\n\xa0\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/12/gods_dream_come_true/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
213,Are We Beatitude People?,"December 29, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nI\u2019m not sure how it happened, exactly, but somehow Christians today seem to have completely misunderstood the Gospel of Jesus. When they hear that an off-color British comedian has endorsed the way of Jesus and has encouraged everyone to take Christ more seriously, their response is to say, \u201cHe\u2019s a hater of God!\u201d and \u201cIf he\u2019s not coming from a Christian perspective, why do we want to listen to him?\u201d\n\n\nInstead of rejoicing that this foul-mouthed comedic actor has openly endorsed the message of Christ, they can only find fault with him because of his past actions and statements.\nWhat about mercy? What about grace?\nIt makes you wonder how these same Christians would have reacted to an anti-Christian terrorist like Saul of Tarsus when he suddenly changed his tune and started preaching the Gospel. \u201cHe\u2019s a hater of God!\u201d \u201cWhy do we want to listen to him?\u201d\nIf we believe we have nothing to learn from those who are outside of our tribe, then we have failed already. Jesus was always going outside of his tribe, outside of his community, outside of his comfort zone.\nThat\u2019s the real problem, I think. We are so unlike Jesus.\nA friend shared a quote from Tertullian today that reminded me that, in his day, the whole Roman world was saying of the Christians \u201cLook how they love one another!\u201d Yet, today, no one marvels at our great love. Not only do we not love one another very well, we don\u2019t love anyone else very well, either.\nAll of this led me back to the Gospels again. I re-read the Sermon on the Mount and was re-inspired by the powerful, radical love of Jesus calling us to an uncommon love that wasn\u2019t just for those who love us in return, but also was extended outward to those who don\u2019t love us, or agree with us, at all.\n\n\n\n\nThis reminded me of a wonderful phrase that I found in N.T. Wright\u2019s latest book where he says:\n\u201c\u2026the Gospels give to those who read them the energy and the sense of direction to be Beatitude people for the world, knowing that the victory was indeed won on the cross, that Jesus is indeed already installed as the world\u2019s rightful ruler, and that His way of peace and reconciliation has been shown to be more powerful than all the powers of the world.\u201d \u2013 N.T. Wright, \u201cThe Day The Revolution Began\u201d, pg. 225\nI long for us to become Beatitude People for the world again; to know that Jesus\u2019 way of peace and reconciliation really is more powerful, and more compelling, than anything else in this world.\nWhat about you? Are you ready to join the Beatitude People who dare to leave their comfort zones and put the words of Jesus into practice?\nEither way, count me in.\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon Best-Seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb,\u201d available in print, Kindle and audiobook versions.

214,Why We Misunderstand Verses Like \u201cGo And Buy A Sword\u201d,"December 23, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\n\n\xa0\nIn the dialog between Christians about whether or not following Jesus entails embracing a non-violent lifestyle, there are certain verses in the New Testament that have to be addressed.\n**\nFor example, whenever non-violent Christians quote Jesus saying, \u201cPut your sword back in its place\u2026for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.\u201d (Matthew 26: 52), there are pro-war Christians who will respond by saying, \u201c(Jesus) said to them, \u2018But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.\u2019\u201d (Luke 22:36)\n\n\n**\xa0\n\nIn other words, some Christians believe that Jesus fully endorsed owning and using weapons for self-defense (or for use in war), and other Christians believe that Jesus categorically prohibited His followers from using violence. What\u2019s the real story?\n\n\xa0**\n\nWell, those verses where Jesus forbid violence are numerous and they are not difficult to understand. In addition to the one quoted above, we also hear Jesus declare that we should love our enemies, do good to those who hate us, turn the other cheek, and forgive those who seek to harm us. These are not figurative passages and taken together they paint (in my mind at least) a pretty straightforward picture of Jesus\u2019 expectation that his disciples would not do violence.\n\n**\n\nIn addition to Jesus\u2019 commands we also have His example of forgiving those who crucified him, healing the ear of the soldier who came to arrest him in the Garden, restraining the Legions of angel soldiers at his command, and telling Pontius Pilate that his Kingdom was not of this Earth, and if it was his disciples would fight, begging the question, \u201cIf His disciples do fight then are they not part of Christ\u2019s Kingdom\u201d? (see John 18:36)\n\n\n\n**\n\nBut this one verse where Jesus tells his disciples to go out and buy a sword is right there in the Bible, isn\u2019t it? What\u2019s it there for? If Jesus didn\u2019t intend for us to own or use swords then why did he say this? Especially if, later on, he was going to contradict himself and rebuke Peter for using the sword he told him to go out and buy?\n\n**\nWell, here\u2019s what I think is going on. First of all we need to look closely at this passage in Luke. Notice that right after Jesus tells his disciples to buy a sword he goes on to say, \u201cFor I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: \u2018And he was numbered with the transgressors.\u2019 For what is written about me has its fulfillment.\u201d And they said, \u201cLook, Lord, here are two swords.\u201d And he said to them, \u201cIt is enough.\u201d (Luke 22:36-38 ESV)\n\n\xa0**\nRight away we can see that Jesus\u2019 statement about the swords is directly related to prophecy (\u201c\u2026this Scripture must be fulfilled in me\u201d) and what is the prophecy that must be fulfilled? The one in Isaiah that says, \u201cAnd he was numbered with the transgressors\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0**\nWas the statement about buying a sword about self-defense? Probably not. Why? Because first of all, two swords are not \u201cenough\u201d to defend 13 guys against a legion of Roman soldiers. Also, because when Peter uses his sword in self-defense (or to protect Jesus from the soldiers) he is harshly rebuked with the verse we\u2019ve already looked at, \u201cPut it away! Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword\u201d.\n\n**\n\nClearly, Jesus is not a fan of self-defense here. At least, not according to the overall context in this passage. However, he does tell the disciples that he wants them to have those two swords with them so that the prophecy about the Messiah being numbered with the transgressors may be fulfilled in Him. That\u2019s why two swords are \u201cenough\u201d for Jesus; to fulfill the scriptures, not to endorse war or physical violence.\n\n\xa0**\nAre we sure that Jesus only meant this in light of fulfilling the prophecies about Himself? Yes. How? Because after Peter cuts off the soldiers ear, listen to what Jesus has to say, \u201cDo you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?\xa0But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?\u201d (Matthew 26:53-54)\n\n\n\n\xa0**\nSee? Jesus tells them to get a few swords so that the prophecy in Isaiah will be fulfilled. Then, once it\u2019s fulfilled in the Garden he makes a point of saying that this is what he had in mind in the first place. So, it\u2019s all about fulfilling the prophecies, not a statement from Jesus endorsing violence.\n\n\xa0**\nAs sincere followers of Jesus we must take into account all the many other teachings of Jesus regarding turning the other cheek, loving our enemies, and not resisting an evil man. We must also be careful to interpret the Old Testament scriptures in light of Jesus, not the other way around (i.e. \u2013 trying to fit Jesus into the Old Testament context).\n\n\xa0**\nJesus came to fulfill the Old Covenant, and He accomplished this in full. The Old Covenant is obsolete. (see Hebrews 8:13) We don\u2019t need to refer back to it again when it comes to guiding our daily lives. We have Christ. We have the Living Word of God who has come to make His home in us. Jesus gave us a New Covenant and He lived a better example for us to follow.\n\n\n\n\xa0**\n\u201cJesus said, \u201cLove your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.\u201d (Luke 6.27-28)\n\n\xa0**\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon best-seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He\u2019s also the co-host of The Heretic Happy Hour Podcast on iTunes and Podbean.\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/12/go-buy-sword/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
215,Why God Can\u2019t Keep A Secret,"December 21, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nIn Colossians, Paul tells us about a great secret that God had from the beginning. It was a marvelous secret. But God just couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut about it.\nWhat is God\u2019s great secret?\n\n\nIt\u2019s Jesus.\nAs Paul puts it, God has \u201chidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge\u201d in Christ. [See Col. 2:3]\nBut God doesn\u2019t want to keep this secret. On the contrary, now that it\u2019s out, He wants everyone \u201cto reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God\u2019s mystery, which is Christ\u2026\u201d [Col. 2:2]\nHow does that happen? Paul says we\xa0continually enter into this ongoing revelation of God\u2019s great mystery [who is Christ] by \u201cwalking in Him..[and] being rooted and built up in Him\u2026[and] being established in the faith\u2026abounding in thanksgiving.\u201d [Col. 2:6-7]\nJesus puts it this way: \u201cAbide in me and I\xa0will abide in you.\u201d\nAs we are continually captivated by God\u2019s unfolding secret, something marvelous happens:\n\u201cFor\xa0in him [Christ] the whole fullness of deity dwells\xa0bodily,\xa0and\xa0you have been filled in him, who is\xa0the head of all rule and authority.\u201d [v. 9-10]\nTake that in\xa0for just a moment: In Christ, the fullness of GOD dwells, and you have now been filled in Christ [who is filled with the fullness of God].\n\n\nThis is why Paul earlier expounds on the idea that\n\u201c\u2026God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are\xa0the riches of the glory of\xa0this mystery, which is Christ in you,\xa0the hope of glory.\u201d [Col. 1:27]\nChrist is now alive in you.\nYou, therefore, are now the new Incarnation of Christ.\nYes, you.\nSo, you and I [who are in Christ] should be able to say with all humility: \u201cIf you have seen me, you have seen the Father.\u201d\nNot in a prideful way at all. But in a very sincere, humble and awestruck manner: God is now making His appeal to everyone through me! [2 Cor. 5:20]\nYou and I now have the supreme honor and privilege of demonstrating the goodness and kindness of God which leads to repentance.\n\n\nAs it says in 1 John 4:17:\n\u201cThis is how love is made complete\xa0among us so that we will have confidence\xa0on the day of judgment: That in this world we are like Jesus.\u201c\nWow.\nIf that\u2019s not strong enough for you, try this one:\n\u201cThis is how we know\xa0we are in him:\xa0Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.\u201d [1 John 2:5-6]\n\n\nSee, God\u2019 s great secret is connected to His grand design for His creation. He intends to remake the World from the inside out \u2013 one person at a time.\nAll that\u2019s necessary is for those who are being transformed by the Love of Christ to walk in the fullness of Christ who is alive in them right now. This is what the whole Universe is expectant for. Not the return of Christ, but the revealing of Christ in His children, here and now:\n\u201cFor all creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.\xa0For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope\xa0\xa0that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.\u201d [Romans 8:19-21]\nAll Creation is eagerly awaiting the Body of Christ to rise up and bring forth the Kingdom of God which lies within each of us. Like tiny seeds of mustard pressed into the dry ground, or a light sprinkling of yeast that spreads within the lump of dough, we are the promise of a Kingdom to come that all Creation yearns for.\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard the secret of God, the next step is to live out of His life that is now flourishing within you. Love as He loves. Give as He gives. Serve as He serves.\nYou and I are the Incarnations of Christ today.\nLet the transformation begin.\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon best-seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He is also co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.

216,Why Did Jesus Save Paul From His Own People?,"December 18, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: The Naked Pastor (Used by permission)\nReading through Acts the other day, I came across a little phrase that stunned me. It\u2019s when Jesus appears to Paul (Saul) on the road to Damascus, knocks him off his ass (literally) and tells him that He is appearing in order to \u201crescue you from the Jewish people\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHere\u2019s the actual passage:\n\u201cI am Jesus whom you are persecuting.\xa0But get up and\xa0stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to\xa0appoint you a\xa0minister and\xa0a witness not only to the things which you have\xa0seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you;\xa0rescuing you\xa0from the\xa0Jewish\xa0people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,\xa0to\xa0open their eyes so that they may turn from\xa0darkness to light and from the dominion of\xa0Satan to God, that they may receive\xa0forgiveness of sins and an\xa0inheritance among those who have been sanctified by\xa0faith in Me.\u201d \u2013 Acts 26:15-18\nHonestly, what surprised me was what Jesus did NOT say to Paul. He did not say that He appeared to save Paul from his sins, or to save Paul from Hell. That would not have surprised me, but what DID surprise me was when Jesus says that one of the reasons He appears to Paul is to \u201csave (him) from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles\u2026\u201d\n\n\nSo, this got me thinking: Why did Paul need to be saved from the Jewish people? What was it that he needed saving from exactly?\nWell, if you keep reading a little more you\u2019ll see that Paul explains what he did after Jesus spoke to him, he says:\n\u201cSo, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision,\xa0but\xa0kept\xa0declaring both\xa0to those of Damascus first, and\xa0also\xa0at Jerusalem and\xa0then\xa0throughout all the region of Judea, and\xa0even\xa0to the Gentiles, that they should\xa0repent and turn to God, performing deeds\xa0appropriate to repentance.\xa0For this reason,\xa0some\xa0Jews\xa0seized me in the temple and tried\xa0to put me to death.\u201d \u2013 Acts 26:19-21\nPaul needed to be rescued from his own people. Why? Because the Jewish people were blind. They were in darkness. Even \u2013 and maybe even especially \u2013 those who were Pharisees like Paul needed to realize their blindness and \u201cto open their eyes so that they (could) turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God.\u201d\n\n\nThat\u2019s heavy stuff.\nThose Pharisees didn\u2019t listen to the Messiah. They killed him. Then they refused to listen to His disciples. They were arrested, beaten and warned not to speak in His name.\nMaybe, just maybe, they would listen to one of their own?\nBut first, Paul needed to be saved from the Jewish people. They had such a grip on his heart and mind. Jesus had to break that hold over Paul first, and then his eyes would be opened to see that actually, he had been under the Dominion of Satan all along.\nI\u2019m sure that was a huge surprise to Paul. Rather than doing the will of God, he was actually an agent of the Devil, persecuting those who followed the Messiah and helping to put them to death in the name of his religion.\nThis is why he needed to be saved from the Jewish people. They were deluded into thinking they were following God, but in actuality, they were following Satan.\nGod\u2019s great love for his children \u2013 both the Jews and the Gentiles \u2013 was manifested in Paul\u2019s vision of Jesus standing before him and blocking his path. \u201cYou\u2019re going the wrong way,\u201d Jesus says to Paul. \u201cYour people have blinded you. I\u2019m saving you from all of that religion and I\u2019m giving you an opportunity to see the truth. This is so that you can help others see the truth, too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn an ironic twist to Paul\u2019s escape from the way of darkness, his eyes were blinded; his eyesight only restored when one of those Christ-followers he was sent to arrest came to him and prayed over him in a show of forgiveness. As Paul experienced this beautiful act of divine love, the scales fell from his eyes and he could finally see, in the face of this Christian man who had risked his life to heal him, a brother and a friend.\nHow did the Jewish people receive Paul\u2019s message? He says \u201csome Jews seized me in the Temple and tried to put me to death.\u201d [v.21]\nAnd why? Partly because they were still blinded and under the Dominion of Satan, but also partly because Paul was preaching something so scandalous and controversial: The idea that Gentiles and Jews were included, together, in the family of God.\nNotice that Paul says he preached this same message \u201cboth\xa0to those of Damascus first, and\xa0also\xa0at Jerusalem and\xa0then\xa0throughout all the region of Judea,\xa0and\xa0even\xa0to the Gentiles,\xa0that they should\xa0repent and turn to God, performing deeds\xa0appropriate to repentance\u201d\xa0and that it was \u201cfor this reason the Jews seized (Paul) in the Temple and tried to put (him) to death.\u201d [v. 19-21]\n\n\nThey had this same reaction when Jesus tried to suggest that God\u2019s great Kingdom of Love was available not only to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles:\n\u201cBut I [Jesus] say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel\xa0in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;\xa0\xa0and yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but\xa0only to\xa0Zarephath,\xa0in the land\xa0of\xa0Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.\xa0And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but\xa0only Naaman the Syrian.\u201d\xa0\xa0And all\xa0the people\xa0in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things;\xa0and they got up and\xa0drove Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him down the cliff.\u201d \u2013\xa0 Luke 4:25-29\n\n\nThis is why Paul calls this the \u201cMystery of Christ\u201d that no one knew. The Mystery hidden from the beginning of the world is that God has always loved the entire World and has always intended for everyone to share in the treasures of His Kingdom:\n\u201cThis mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs\xa0together with Israel, members together of one body,\xa0and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.\u201d \u2013 Ephesians 3:6\nWhat a glorious revelation! This is why Jesus had to save Paul from his own people, and from the Gentiles, so that the Jews and the Gentiles together could realize their blindness and together become one \u201cnew man\u201d in Christ!\nSome people today want to divide up what God has joined together, but Jesus is clear when he says \u201d For God so loved the World\u201d and Paul affirms this when he declares that \u201cnow, in the Church, there is no longer any Jew or Gentile\u2026but all are one in Christ Jesus.\u201d (See Gal. 3:28)\nNote: Paul doesn\u2019t say that there are now both Jews and Gentiles. He says that now there is neither Jew nor Gentile. Why? Because they have now become one in Christ, Jesus our Lord.\n\n\nThe Jews were about division. The Gentiles were, too. Jesus is about reconciliation. He wants to bring everyone together into the Family of God. Where we draw lines of separation, Jesus\u2019 erases those lines. Where we seek to identify ourselves as \u201cbetter than\u201d others, Jesus calls us to \u201cconsider others better than ourselves.\u201d\nSometimes I wonder if there are even Christians today who need to be saved from their own people so that they can realize how blind they are to the Gospel of Peace and the Mystery of Christ that has now been revealed for those who have eyes to see.\nGod\u2019s love and mercy are for everyone, not just for us.\nWhat do you think?\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He is also the co-host of \u201cThe Heretic Happy Hour\u201d podcast which is available on iTunes and Podbean.

217,God\u2019s Brilliant Trap,"December 16, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage:Pixabay\n\n\u201cAs for you, you were dead in our transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air\u2026All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature children of ire, but because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in our transgressions\u2026\u201d [Eph. 2:1-5]\n\n\nAs I was reading this passage the other day, I observed something I had not noticed in quite the same way before. Here, Paul describes how cleverly God designed a trap that perfectly captured us and catapulted us from death into life.\nHere\u2019s how it works: First, God knew that we were dead in our sins. He saw clearly how we thought and how our actions were motivated by our lusts and desires. Like tossing red meat into a school of sharks, God sent His Anointed One into this cesspool of humanity. What else could happen next? As with the prophets that came before Jesus, we turned on Him and put Him to death. Just exactly as He knew we would.\nBut, notice what happened next: \u201cBecause of His great love for us, God\u2026made us alive with Christ\u2026\u201d\nPaul skips over the crucifixion part, but it\u2019s clearly in play. We are dead people who are ruled by our lusts. Jesus the Holy One walks among us and we, driven by our sinful natures and evil thoughts, take Him and crucify Him.\nSuddenly, God\u2019s brilliant trap is sprung. When we kill the Author of Life, He descends into the bowels of death and ignites the resurrection power within to \u201cmake us alive with Christ, even when we were dead in our transgressions.\u201d\n\n\n \n\nBoom.\nDon\u2019t you love that? I can\u2019t help but read it all again and smile.\nGod set a trap for us who were dead and Jesus became the catalyst that we killed so that resurrection could be released and everyone could be made alive with Christ.\nThat\u2019s genius.\nPaul concludes this by saying:\n\u201cAnd God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages He might demonstrate to everyone the incomparable riches of His grace, expressed in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.\u201d [v.6-7]\nDo you see how much He loves you?

218,"If Hell Isn\u2019t Eternal, Why Preach The Gospel?","December 14, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nFor most of us, the idea of an eternal hell is almost universally accepted as being what the Bible teaches. We almost cannot imagine any other view being taken seriously.\nHowever, that was not always the case. In fact, for MOST of early Church history, there were 3 different views of Hell, and the eternal suffering viewpoint was in the minority.\nImage: Pixabay\nNote this reference in the New Schaff-Herzog Christian Encyclopedia which says:\n\n\n\u201cThe earliest system of Universalistic theology was by Clement of Alexandria who was the head of the theological school in that city until 202 A.D. His successor in the school was the great Origen, the most distinguished advocate of this doctrine in all time.\u201d\xa0(From the New Schaff-Herzog, page 96, paragraph 2)\n\u201cIn the first five or six centuries of Christianity there were six known theological schools, of which four (Alexandria, Antioch, Caesarea, and Edessa, or Nisibis) were Universalist; one (Ephesus) accepted conditional immortality; one (Carthage or Rome) taught endless punishment of the wicked.\u201d\xa0(From the New Schaff-Herzog, page 96, paragraph 3)\nSo, what are the other two views?\nOne view is \u201cUniversalism\u201d. This view teaches that those who die without Christ will suffer for a season of time but that this suffering has a purpose: To bring correction and to purify their souls to \u201cburn away the wood, hay and stubble and reveal the gold, silver and precious stones,\u201d because \u201cthe Lord disciplines those He loves\u201d and this correction is intended to lead us to repentance.\xa0 In this view, everyone will eventually accept Christ as Lord.\n\n\nThe other view is the \u201cAnnihilationist\u201d view which teaches that those who die without Christ will suffer for a limited time in Hell and then be destroyed forever and cease to exist.\nThere are plenty of verses in the Bible to support both of these views of Hell.\nMany Christians are also unaware that when Augustine attempted to refute the Universalist view of hell \u2013 which was the majority view in his day \u2013 he freely admitted that his doctrine (Eternal Suffering) was against the grain and in the minority.\nWhat are we to make of this?\nWell, it seems that the Old Testament scriptures hardly mention the topic, and when Jesus speaks of the \u201cdeath\u201d (perishing, destruction, etc.) of the unrepentant sinner, it\u2019s more likely that he was referring to the fate of those who would die in the horrific events of AD 70 when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, and the Temple, not an eternal conscious torture that would happen after the end of time.\nWe also know that the early Church had no widely-accepted concept of eternal suffering.\nPlus, Paul never used the word \u201cHell\u201d in any of his writings. When he did speak of fire it was a cleansing fire, not a punitive one.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gospel of John never uses the word \u201cHell\u201d and none of the Apostles ever mentioned Hell in their sermons about the Gospel in the book of Acts.\nAll of this makes it more likely that the views of Annihilationism and Universalism are much more in line with what Scripture teaches.\nEven if you don\u2019t agree with that statement, I have to admit that my own studies have led me to move away from the commonly held doctrine of Eternal Suffering as it seems very weak in comparison to the other two views.\nSo, this has led me into some fascinating conversations with some of my Christian friends. Many ask me, \u201cIf the doctrine of Eternal Conscious Torment isn\u2019t true, why preach the Gospel at all?\u201d\nThis question really disturbs me, honestly. It reduces the Gospel to little more than a \u201cGet-Out-Of-Hell-Free\u201d card.\nIf knowing Christ doesn\u2019t make your heart sing, and if your daily walk with Jesus isn\u2019t a reward enough, then I\u2019m not sure I can explain it to you.\nWithout Jesus there is no life. Without Jesus there is no love, or peace, or joy.\n\n\nWhy evangelize others if God doesn\u2019t plan to torture people forever in the lake of fire? Because Jesus is the best thing about being alive and there\u2019s nothing in the world more amazing than knowing Him.\nAsking this question betrays the reality that many Christians really haven\u2019t fully experienced the beauty of being in communion with the Creator of the Universe.\nWhy evangelize if hell isn\u2019t forever?\nBecause His love is better than life. \nBecause in His presence are joys everlasting. \nBecause He has the words of life. \nBecause we have tasted and seen that the Lord is good.\n\n\nBecause He loved us so much that He gave up His life for us.\nBecause we love Him and we want to bring Him joy when another one of His children learns to love Him as we do.\nHow many more reasons do we really need?\n-kg\nWANT TO LEARN MORE?

219,How Evangelicals Are Taking the \u201cChrist\u201d Out Of Christianity,"December 13, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nAmerican Christians have an unfortunate blind spot when it comes to politics. While they worry about how to put \u201cChrist\u201d back into Christmas, many of them are slowly but surely taking the \u201cChrist\u201d out of Christianity.\nImage: Pixabay\nFor example, for the last few weeks Christian leaders like Jerry Falwell, Jr.,\xa0Franklin Graham, James Dobson, and others have vocally supported the Republican candidate for the US Senate in Alabama, Roy Moore, and last night 80% of White Evangelical Christians voted to place him in office. They failed. But that failure doesn\u2019t change the fact that today there are still millions of Christians in Alabama who actually believe that Moore stands for \u201cChristian Values\u201d.\n\n\nBy \u201cChristian Values,\u201d they mean \u201cConservative Republican Values,\u201d not the values of Jesus as expressed in the Gospels or in the Sermon on the Mount. To hear Roy Moore\u2019s version of \u201cChristian Values\u201d simply look at what he has said throughout this campaign and\xa0over the last decade of his career as a politician\xa0and a judge. Very little of what he says is informed by anything taught by Jesus.\nMoore has said he wants to eliminate every Amendment to the Constitution after the Tenth. This means he\u2019s in favor of taking away voting rights for Black Americans and Women. He\u2019s also said that America was \u201cGreat\u201d when white families owned slaves.\nNone of this was objectionable to 80% of the White Christian voters in Alabama. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned the 9 women who have accused Moore of sexual misconduct and trying to date several of them when they were underage. This apparently didn\u2019t bother those Alabama Christians either. They were willing to overlook all of these infractions because there were more important things at stake. Like maintaining a Republican majority in the Senate, for example.\n\n\nThis is not Christianity. This, pure and simple, is Nationalism.\nSpecifically, this is Christian Nationalism and it\u2019s slowly rotting the American Evangelical Church from the inside out.\nThis unholy entanglement of faith and politics has effectively manipulated a religious group that identifies with Jesus and twisted them into a voting block that is primarily driven more by political interests than the Sermon on the Mount.\nAs comedian Doug Stanhope has said, \u201cNationalism teaches you to hate people you\u2019ve never met and to take pride in accomplishments you have no part in.\u201d\nFor White Evangelical Christians, those \u201cpeople (they\u2019ve) never met\u201d include Muslims, Immigrants and people in the LGBTQ community. Moore has gone out of his way to condemn all three of these people groups in his campaign for Senate. He said that a person of the Muslim faith shouldn\u2019t be allowed to hold office, accused immigrants of taking our jobs, and argued that homosexuality should be illegal.\n\n\nAgain, none of these things are synonymous with anything Jesus ever said. To the contrary, Jesus famously taught his followers to love their neighbors \u2013 even if they were from another race or religious group (as famously portrayed in the Parable of the Good Samaritan) \u2013 and said nothing at all about homosexuality in any of the Gospels.\nBut for an overwhelming majority of white Christians in Alabama, this is irrelevant. Moore\u2019s platform resonates emphatically with their Conservative Republican values and that is close enough.\nHowever, it\u2019s not just an Alabama problem. Many Christians in America are oblivious to the way their political entanglement and tribalism have led them away from the teachings of Jesus and into the heart of darkness.\nIt started a long time ago. As Princeton historian Kevin Kruse details in his book,\xa0\u201cOne Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America,\u201d\xa0our country\u2019s religious prostitution began in the 1950\u2019s. That was when, as Kruse explains, business leaders plotted to link Christianity, Republican politics, and libertarian economics tightly together.\nWhy? Simply to create a feeling of solidarity between Christians and Corporations who might both see \u201cBig Government\u201d as a common enemy.\n\n\n\n\nThis is where our national motto, \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d (1956), and a new line in the Pledge of Allegiance was added: \u201cOne nation under God\u201d (1954) came from.\nTheir goal was simple: To entangle Christianity with Republican politics in order to benefit big business.\nThe entanglement agenda reached a fever pitch when Christians in the Moral Majority registered thousands of voters to put Ronald Reagan into office on his promise to take a stand for Christian values. They rallied to vote Reagan into the oval office twice. But in the end they got nothing in return; no abortion repeal and no legislation on school prayer.\nIn spite of the fact that they supposedly had the ear of the American President (who many believed was a dedicated Christian), and a six-year Republican majority in the Senate, Christians were left holding the bag. The Republican party got what they wanted, but the Evangelical Christians in America got nothing.\nAs former Moral Majority leader Ed Dobson said about this in his book \u201cBlinded By Might\u201d:\n\u201cWhat did Reagan do for us in eight years of office? He gave us credibility, and he ultimately did nothing in terms of our long-term agendas.\u201d \xa0\n\n\nSimply put: Entanglement works.\nToday, many Christian leaders and pastors vocally support candidates that a few years ago would have been rebuked by the Church for their shameful behaviors. But today these politicians are unapologetically embraced so that the Republican party can gain power and maintain dominance in the House or the Senate.\nThe entanglement of the Christian faith with politics is now pervasive. It has saturated the Evangelical Christian identity.\nThankfully, many Christians are waking up to the dangers of entanglement, including conservative political columnist\xa0Dana Hall McCain who\xa0recently\xa0said:\n\u201cHere\u2019s where we are: the GOP has come to understand that Evangelicals are trained seals. We show up and clap for any clown you can slap a Republican jersey on. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a godly or wise person. Our votes are a sure thing, and we\u2019ll turn out and vote for problematic or corrupt GOP candidates far more consistently than non-religious conservatives. So come to terms with the fact that the church isn\u2019t influencing diddly squat, not even in our favorite party. To the contrary, the church is the one being influenced \u2014 and our credibility before a lost and dying world destroyed \u2014 because we have believed the great lie about political engagement.\n\n\nWe have all the power in the world, but we lack the faith to exercise it. They own us\xa0because we don\u2019t trust God enough to call the bluff.\u201d\nShe\u2019s right: Christians already have \u201call the power in the world\u201d and it\u2019s called \u201cThe Gospel.\u201d Unfortunately, American Christians have slowly abandoned all faith in that power to transform hearts and minds from the inside-out and they have traded it for legislative power to govern from the top-down.\nThe entanglement of Christianity and Conservative Politics is now fully realized. Many Christians in America cannot separate their faith from their politics. They are more American than Christian. They cannot imagine following Jesus apart from political action or influence via their political party.\nThose on the outside of the Christian faith cannot see the difference between their faith and their politics either. This is probably one of the more damaging aspects of this entanglement. Christianity, to a non-Christian, looks more like a political party, not a way of loving our neighbors or following the teachings of Jesus.\nBecause American Christianity has become so completely entangled with Conservative Republican politics, the faith has become impotent and irrelevant for a growing number of people. Thousands of people are leaving the faith because they are sick of this political entanglement. The Evangelical Church in America is on the decline. They are slowly becoming older as younger members opt out of the movement and they\xa0have inevitably headed\xa0the way of the dinosaur as older members die out.\n\n\nEven if the younger generations wanted to follow Jesus what they find when they enter most American Christian churches smell a lot more like politics than the aroma of Christ. Until Evangelicals abandon their lust for political power, they cannot fully embrace their faith. Or, as one wise man once put it: \u201cYou cannot serve two masters. You will hate one and love the other.\u201d\nThe simple truth is this: Roy Moore may have lost the Senate race in Alabama, but Evangelical Christianity has lost far more than this by supporting such an un-Christ-like candidate.\nTo the Church in America I say, repent of your Nationalism and crucify your politics. It\u2019s time to pledge allegiance to the Lamb while you still can.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of the Amazon best-seller, \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d available in print, ebook and audiobook formats.\n\xa0\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/12/evangelicals-taking-christ-christianity/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
220,Has Jesus Asked You Into His Life?,"December 8, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\u201cIf you stopped learning today you wouldn\u2019t live long enough to put into practice all that you already know.\u201d \u2013 Fenelon, 15th century Bishop. [Paraphrased from the book, \u201cLet Go\u201d]\nThis quote has stuck with me for a long time now. I believe it\u2019s true. For most of us, the time for learning new information about Jesus is long over. It\u2019s way past the time for putting into practice what we already know that Jesus commanded us to do.\n\n\nSadly, most of us would rather continue to read and learn and study, and then re-learn and re-study, and taking lots of notes until Jesus comes back.\nBut Jesus isn\u2019t coming back for people who know stuff about Him. It\u2019s why He said: \u201cWhy do you call me \u2018Lord, Lord\u2019 and do not do what I command?\u201d (Luke 6:46)\nWe typically think that when we know something we are blessed. As if having the right information is all that is required of us. But that\u2019s not the case at all. Jesus stresses that we are blessed, not when we know what he says, but when we do what He says:\n\u201cNow that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.\u201d\xa0 (John 13:17)\nBecause Jesus knows that having the right information about the Gospel is worthless if you do not obey the Gospel.\nIn other words, it\u2019s not how much information about Jesus we have. It\u2019s what we do with that information once we have it.\nThe great Christian philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard put it this way:\n\u201cThe Bible is very easy to understand. But we Christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand, we are obliged to act accordingly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWhat Jesus wants us to do is to stop trying to live for Him and start allowing Him to live in us.\nUntil Jesus is alive in you \u2013 living and breathing within \u2013 you are not really alive anyway. Remember, Jesus told us: \u201cApart from me you can do nothing\u201d (John 15:5)\nAnd we are told that \u201cWhoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God, does not have life.\u201d (1 John 5:12)\nSo, let\u2019s not ask ourselves \u201cWhat can I do for God?\u201d but let\u2019s ask, \u201cWhat could God through me if I was totally and completely surrendered to Him?\u201d\nThat\u2019s the Gospel of the Kingdom: One life totally surrendered to His rule and reign.\nCan we take that step? Can we begin, right now, to let Jesus have His way with us? Can we lay down our lives and let Him live in us by His Spirit?\nHonestly, that\u2019s what Jesus came and died for \u2013\xa0all of you! Not just a little piece of you, but every single part; even (and especially) that part of yourself that you are most afraid of surrendering to Him. (You know what I\u2019m talking about).\n\n\nThe Good New is: He is trustworthy. He won\u2019t mess up your life. Instead, He will give you real, abundant life, starting the moment you let go of this one, which in reality is no real \u201clife\u201d at all, and take hold of His Life which is more astounding than you can possibly imagine.\n\u201cFor whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d (Matt. 16:25-26)\nJesus doesn\u2019t want you to ask Him into your life. He wants to invite you into His life.\nPlease RSVP today.\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon best-seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He is also the co-founder of Pacifist Fight Club and co-host of the Heretic Happy Hour Podcast.

221,How Bad Theology Drives American Foreign Policy,"December 7, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about Donald Trump declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel? Well, for Christians who take a Futurist view of Prophecy, it supports their notion that certain conditions need to apply in order for the Anti-Christ to rise up so that Jesus can return and Rapture the Church.\n\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Mike Pence \u2013 a very strong Christian Zionist \u2013 was standing behind Trump when he announced this unprecedented shift in policy. Pence no doubt had more to do with this decision than Trump, since the Vice President has long voiced an affinity for Dispensational Theology which is where all of this nonsense originates.\nWhat is Dispensationalism? It\u2019s a fairly recent theology that started in 1830 when John Nelson Darby decided that there were still promises made to Israel that were not yet fulfilled. Up to that point, Christianity taught that Christ was the fulfillment of those promises. Darby ignored that and created a new theology that took root in America thanks to the Scofield Bible and several seminaries.\nHere\u2019s a quick overview of what Dispensationalism teaches regarding the \u201cEnd Times\u201d and how Jerusalem (supposedly) plays a part in all of it.\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever studied any of the End Times scriptures (Daniel, Ezekiel, Revelation, etc.), or even heard someone talk about prophetic scriptures\xa0regarding the end of the world or the second coming of Christ, you\u2019ve no doubt heard the phrase, \u201cThe Abomination of Desolation\u201d. But what is it? What does that mean?\nThe phrase appears more than once in the scriptures. Three times in the OT book of Daniel, and three times in the NT during the \u201cOlivet Discourse\u201d by Jesus which is recorded in Matthew 24:15-16, Mark 13:14 and Luke 21:20.\nIn the three Daniel references it appears to be about three different things (not about one single thing, and therefore not necessarily about the same event that Jesus is talking about in his Olivet Discourse).\nFirst, let\u2019s examine what Jesus calls \u201cThe Abomination of Desolation\u201d in his Olivet Discourse which is recorded in three of the four Gospels, (Matthew, Mark and Luke). Each of these are nearly identical, with a few changes here and there \u2013 and this is for our benefit as it turns out.\nFor example, if we could lay these three passages side-by-side we would notice that all of them follow the exact same flow, except for a few sections in Matthew where he consolidates a few references from other encounters where Jesus spoke on the same topic. (This is something Matthew does often and it\u2019s also why you shouldn\u2019t look to that Gospel for chronological info about what Jesus did and when, but more on that in another blog).\n\n\nLaying these three passages side-by-side we notice a similar flow of thought. They are, after all, the same Olivet Discourse that Jesus\u2019 gave to His disciples regarding a prophecy about the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (which would occur roughly forty years later in AD 70).\nThe part in the Olivet Discourse that deals with the \u201cAbomination that causes desolation\u201d look like this in Matthew and Mark:\n\u201cSo when you see standing in the holy place \u2018the abomination that causes desolation,\u2019 spoken of through the prophet Daniel\u2014let the reader understand\u2014 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\u201d (Matthew 24:15-16)\n\u201cWhen you see \u2018the abomination that causes desolation\u2019 standing where it does not belong\u2014let the reader understand\u2014then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\u201d (Mark 13:14)\nNotice that both use the similar phrases, but Matthew adds \u201cspoken of through the prophet Daniel\u201d and Mark adds \u201cwhere it does not belong\u201d. Otherwise, they are identical.\nNow, look at what Luke reports in his Gospel:\n\u201cWhen you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains\u2026\u201d (Luke 21:20-21)\n\n\nHmm\u2026that\u2019s fascinating, isn\u2019t it? Whereas Matthew and Mark used the phrase from Daniel \u2013 \u201cThe abomination that causes desolation\u201d, Luke instead simply explains exactly what it means \u2013 \u201cWhen you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies\u2026\u201d\nMystery solved. Matthew and Mark quote the phrase from Daniel about the \u201cAbomination that causes desolation\u201d, but Luke plainly describes what that looks like for the reader who might not understand (as both Matthew and Mark suggest in their more cryptic phraseology).\n\nLet\u2019s look at the three Daniel references now. These are found in Daniel 9:27; 11:31; and 12:11.First, Daniel 9:27:\n\u201cAnd he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations shall come one that maketh desolate; and even unto the full end, and that determined, shall wrath be poured out upon the desolate.\u201d (Daniel 9:27)\nThis prophecy appears to be about Jesus Himself. Notice that it says that \u201che shall make a firm covenant with many for one week\u201d. Who is \u201che\u201d? Let\u2019s back up to verse 25 where the angel Gabriel tells Daniel: \u201cKnow therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWho is the \u201cAnointed one\u201d? Well, keep in mind that \u201cMessiah\u201d means, \u201cThe Anointed One\u201d and it will be clear that this is a prophecy about the coming of the Messiah.\nThat means that in verse 27 the \u201cHe shall make a firm covenant with many for one week\u2026\u201d is Jesus, who made a New Covenant in the upper room with His disciples the week that he was crucified.\n\n\n\nNotice also that the verse goes on to say that \u201che\u201d would \u201ccause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease\u201d, and that\u2019s exactly what Jesus did since during His crucifixion there was an earthquake and the veil in the Temple was split from top to bottom. That most certainly stopped the sacrifice in the Temple as the prophecy says. What\u2019s more, since Jesus\u2019 sacrifice upon the cross was as the \u201cLamb of God who takes away the sins of the world\u201d, there is now no need for any other sacrifice within the earthly Temple.\nThe following note about one who \u201cupon the wing of abominations shall come..(and) maketh desolate\u2026\u201d is most likely about the Roman armies that came in AD 70 and destroyed Jerusalem and finally put a decisive end to the daily Temple sacrifices. (And these remain so more than 2,000 years later).\n\n\nThe second passage, Daniel 11:31, says:\n\u201cAnd forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual burnt-offering, and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate.\u201d\nMany scholars feel that this was fulfilled during the reign of Antiocus Epiphanes, a Greek king who, many years before the coming of the Messiah, erected an idol to Zeus and offered a pig on the altar in the Temple.\nFinally, in Daniel 12:11 we read:\n\xa0\n\u201cAnd from the time that the continual burnt-offering shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days.\u201d\n\xa0\nThis passage appears to be a reference to something that happens after the abomination of desolation is over, but never tells us what happens, only that the time span between the abomination and the end of the daily sacrifice will be 1,290 days\u2026and then? We don\u2019t know exactly.\n\nThe prophecies about the Anointed One \u2013 that\u2019s Jesus \u2013 and the eventual Abomination of Desolation which would culminate in \u201cthe shattering of the power of the holy people (the Jews)\u201d (12:7) and the \u201cend of the (Jewish) age\u201d (12:13), have already been fulfilled.\n\n\n\nSo, the references in the Bible to the \u201cAbomination of Desolation\u201d refer either to:\nA) The destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 AD, as Jesus predicted, or\nB) to the event where Antiocus Epiphanes profaned the temple in 167 BC.\n\n\nNow, in the minds of the Dispensationalist Christians (which make up a very large portion of Christians in America), this \u201cAbomination of Desolation\u201d is something still needs to happen in the future. To them, Jesus can\u2019t return until the Anti-Christ appears and the \u201cAbomination of Desolation\u201d occurs, (something that has already happened but that they think still needs to happen). They believe this will happen when a new Jewish Temple is rebuilt in Jerusalem, but that won\u2019t happen if Israel doesn\u2019t control Jerusalem.\n\nThe decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel simply plays into this Zionist theology and lays another plank in the bridge towards Armageddon, which Dispensationalists want to encourage so that Jesus can return.\n\nIn the meantime, this theology is toxic for the rest of us. It fuels political decision-making that provokes outrage and violence in the Middle East and quickly becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It creates the very violence that it expects to occur. Almost to say, \u201cSee? Look how violent those Muslims get when we take away their land and thumb our noses at their religion.\u201d\n\nThe violence has already started due to this misguided step towards Armageddon. It will not end well for anyone, not even those American Christians who believe they are helping God out by stoking a Holy War in the Middle East.\n\nIf Dispensationalism wins, we all lose.\n\nBecause what American Dispensationalists don\u2019t understand is that there are thousands of Christians in Palestine who suffer the most when they provoke conflict between Jews and Muslims in Israel. These brothers and sisters in Christ are the ones who will become the targets of violence from both sides. Their children will be killed in the bombings. Their homes will be torn apart in the riots. Their community will become toxic in the aftermath.\n\nThis is another reason why Christianity and Politics do not mix well. It\u2019s like mixing manure and ice cream: It doesn\u2019t hurt the manure, but it really ruins the ice cream.\n\nToday, I am praying for the peace of Palestine. I hope you\u2019ll join me.\n\n\nPeace,\n\n\n-kg\nLEARN MORE:\nDispensationalism Refuted \u2013 Rebuilding The Temple?\n\nKeith Giles is the author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and co-hosts the \u201cHeretic Happy Hour\u201d podcast.\n\xa0\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/12/dispensationalims_jerusalem/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
222,Recovering the Lost Epistle of Jesus,"December 6, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nAs I have been studying the scriptures and investigating the canon of the New Testament lately, I made a remarkable discovery about a lost Epistle of Christ.\nNow, there are a few epistles of Paul that we know about that have been lost, like the Epistle to the Laodiceans, and an ealier Epistle to the Corinthians that predates our 1 Corinthians, for example. But most Christians, and even many New Testament scholars, do not know that there is one epistle that was delivered by Paul and the Apostles that almost no one has ever read before.\n\n\nIt\u2019s true. Paul himself even tells us about this lost epistle in 2 Corinthians and he personally testifies to the fact that it was written by Jesus personally and inspired by the Holy Spirit.\n\xa0\nImage: Pixabay\n\xa0\nHow can this be? How have we missed the existence of an epistle written personally by Jesus and delivered to the early Church by Paul and the other Apostles?\nI blame the Pharisees. Not those first-century Jewish teachers of the Law that opposed Jesus, but their spiritual successors who continually search the scriptures for life and miss the actual Author of Life whom the scriptures are pointing to.\nThere are Pharisees of the New Testament scriptures today, even as there were Pharisees of the Old Testament scriptures then.\nThese Pharisees, and their disciples, hold up the written \u201cWord of God\u201d as having some absolute, unquestionable authority over our lives while ignoring the fact that those same scriptures point to a living \u201cWord of God\u201d who became flesh \u2013 not paper \u2013 and now lives within each and every one of His children by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\n\n\n\nSimply put, we are blind to the lost Epistle of Christ because we can\u2019t look past the Bible. It\u2019s like looking at the forest and missing the tree.\nSo, what exactly is the \u201cEpistle of Christ\u201d that Paul talks about? Where is it now? What happened to it? Why can\u2019t we read it today?\nHere\u2019s what Paul says about it:\n\u201cYou yourselves are our epistle, written on our\xa0hearts, to be known and read by all.\xa0And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of\xa0the living God, not on\xa0tablets of stone but on\xa0tablets of\xa0human hearts.\u201d (2 Cor. 3:2-3)\nThe lost Epistle of Christ is you. You are the letter that Jesus wrote, and continues to write, every single day. As long as you remain in connection with Jesus, He is writing a letter of love on your heart. He writes a new chapter every single day that you are alive, and with every breath you take He writes another verse about His incredible love for you, and His intense desire to change this broken world from the inside out \u2013 starting with you.\nSo, the lost letter of Jesus is written within you, and it is meant to be read by those around you. This means your life should literally be an open book to your family, friends, neighbors, co-workers and acquaintances. The story of Jesus should entice people to read further, to turn the page, and to get lost in those verses of Divine affection.\n\n\nThere is a missing chapter in every Bible ever printed. It\u2019s you and your story of Jesus. He intends for it to \u201cbe known and read by all.\u201d\nDon\u2019t let this lost letter of Jesus get lost again. Deliver it today.\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

223,Why We Hold So Tightly To These Disputed Epistles,"December 5, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\nTwo of the most disputed books in the New Testament are 2 Peter and 2 Timothy. In fact, the majority of New Testament scholars doubt that either of those letters were actually written by Paul or Peter at all, holding instead that some other writers who may have been disciples of these Apostles \u2013 or disciples of their disciples \u2013 took it upon themselves to add these epistles at a much later date.\n\n\nThis sort of thing was not uncommon in the ancient world, by the way. A disciple of Plato, for example, would not consider it deceptive to write something and attribute it to his master after his passing. It would have been seen as a continuation of the philosopher\u2019s teaching and widely accepted in the culture as a valid extension of the teacher\u2019s thoughts. The anonymity of the writer would have been regarded as more of an honor to Plato \u2013 almost as an act of humility to remove oneself from the conversation so that the wisdom of the master could take center stage \u2013 rather than as an act of deception intended to lead people astray.\nTo those contemporary with the work produced, there would be no issues with evaluating the writings based on these conditions. It would have been common knowledge to everyone that the works were not written by the mentor but were additional thoughts shared by one of his students.\nOf course, over the\xa0centuries such details as to authorship could be lost to the fog of time and eventually, those writings could be taken to be original with the master rather than additions by later disciples.\nThis is the sort of thing that many New Testament scholars believe is happening with 2 Peter and 2 Timothy.\n\n\nFor one thing, 2 Peter is patterned almost entirely from the book of Jude. Scholars have known this for centuries and most conclude that Jude was written first and whoever wrote 2 Peter simply used Jude as a template and added in a few new details to construct 2 Peter.\nAnother reason to doubt the Petrine authorship of 2 Peter is that early church fathers didn\u2019t consider it scripture. We know this because many did not mention the epistle in their list of accepted scriptures. This could have been because they knew it wasn\u2019t actually written by Peter, or because it had not been written yet \u2013 and therefore couldn\u2019t have been written by Peter who was already martyred for his faith.\nOther reasons for doubting 2 Peter are strong linguistic differences as compared to 1 Peter (assuming Peter wrote that epistle) and a shifting eschatological view that attempts to explain why the return of Jesus is taking so long, whereas earlier letters seem to argue for an imminent return of Christ. The argument is that if Peter actually wrote 2 Peter, and if he died between AD 65 and 67, there was no reason to explain why Jesus was taking so long to return since he would have only been gone for a few years. However, if the book was written much later then Christians at that time would have been asking questions about the length of time that had passed and need reassurance about that.\n\n\n\n\nStill other reasons for doubting 2 Peter are that the author says things like, \u201cThis is the second letter I am writing to you\u201d which seems quite unnecessary to mention, unless it was for the benefit of those who might doubt that it was the second letter, and also that the author mentions that he is writing this letter just before he is about to die, something it\u2019s hard to say that Peter would necessarily have known about in advance.\nOne of the most compelling reasons that New Testament scholars have for overlooking all of this is that 2 Peter is the only book in the New Testament that refers to the writings of Paul as scripture. In other words, if they were to admit that Peter didn\u2019t write this letter, then they would also have to admit that Peter did not consider Paul\u2019s letters to be scripture.\nBut what about 2 Timothy? This epistle, along with the other so-called \u201cPastoral Epistles\u201d (1 Timothy and Titus) are largely considered to be written by someone other than Paul by about 80% of New Testament scholars.\nSimilar to 2 Peter, the reasons for concluding that someone else wrote those three epistles are linked to linguistic evidence (words used that were unique and not found in other Pauline epistles), theological evidence (arguments that appear to address problems that did not arise until long after Paul\u2019s death), and they do not address themes that were common to the unquestioned epistles (namely our unity with Christ). In addition, the 3 \u201cPastoral Epistles\u201d reference a much more hierarchical form of church leadership than was in place at the time of the Apostles, and it is curious that many portions of 2 Timothy borrow heavily from Philippians which is an accepted Pauline epistle, suggesting that whoever penned the book used elements of Philippians to assist the process.\n\n\nI believe one of the main reasons for overlooking all of this evidence and accepting Pauline authorship of 2 Timothy is that this is the only book in the New Testament that says \u201call scripture is God-breathed\u201d and to relinquish Apostolic authority of such a statement is too dangerous for most to accept.\nSo, in the face of so many good reasons to doubt that Peter wrote 2 Peter, or that Paul wrote 2 Timothy, many Christians today seem to cling even more tightly to them. Perhaps it\u2019s because those two epistles provide their strongest arguments for how scripture itself is defined and defended.\nWhat do you think?\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

224,Jesus Worships Us,"December 5, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Hannah Dulaney\nThe Greek word for \u201cworship\u201d is\xa0proskyne\u014d\xa0and it is translated as \u201cto kiss, to lower oneself in humility or reverence, to adore, to surrender completely to another\u201d.\nSo, when Jesus let go of His equality with God [see Phil. 2] and humbled Himself and took on the form of a servant, and became nothing, He was doing exactly what anyone does when they worship something.\nFor example:\n\nJesus \u201clowered himself in humility\u201d\nJesus became a servant to mankind.\nJesus adored us and gave himself up for us.\nJesus looked upon us and loved us.\nJesus completely surrendered his life to us.\nJesus placed his life, and safety in the hands of his earthly parents.\nJesus gave us power over himself, even to the point of abusing him and putting him to death.\n\n\n\nJesus, in essence, went from being the One who was worshiped night and day by the cherubim of heaven to become a servant who washed the feet of his own disciples.\nIn his own words, Jesus declares that He did not come to be served \u2013 as a God should expect to be \u2013 but that He came to serve us. [See Mark 10:45]\nMake no mistake: This was an act of worship.\nNow, it is quite normal for us to think of God as someone that we should worship. We understand that God is God and that we are not. So, we naturally apply the term \u201cworship\u201d whenever we think of how we interact with God.\nToday, worship is a multi-million-dollar industry. Record labels, artists, songwriters, conferences and even workshops are all devoted to worship. Usually, this worship is in the form of music, but scripturally-speaking, worship is really more about the way we live our lives in relationship to God.\nIn Romans 12, for example, Paul tells us that we should offer our bodies to God as a living sacrifice and that this is holy and pleasing to God; calling it \u201cour true and proper act of worship.\u201d\n\n\n \n\nNothing about singing songs there; Simply laying our lives down at His feet in adoration and complete surrender.\nIn other words, when we give up our lives for Christ, this is what worship looks like.\nJust the same way that Jesus gave Himself up for us, as Paul reminds us in Ephesians 5:25, we should also give up our lives for Him, and for one another.\nSee, Jesus showed us what worship really looks like. When He stepped down from the throne and humbled Himself and became a servant to us, He was demonstrating to the entire Universe what worship really is.\nSo, on that basis, and by following His astounding example, we should also worship Him by giving up our lives as living sacrifices.\nThis is what honors God. This is what gives Him joy. When we understand that His love for us compelled Him to kneel down and serve us, and yes, to worship us with an absolute adoration that drove Him to the cross and exploded from the grave in victory, how else can we respond?\nHow can you not love a God who gave Himself up for you?\n\n\nHow can you not serve a God who first served you?\nHow can you not worship a God who would lay everything down and worship you until it killed Him?\nThere is no one like our God.\nLet us worship.\n-kg\n\xa0Note: Special Thanks to Jordan Hathcock for inspiring this blog post.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

225,Dear America: An Apology,"December 4, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nDear America,\nI want to apologize. On behalf of my brothers and sisters in the Christian Church, I need to say that I\u2019m sorry that we have failed you.\nImage: Pixabay\nWe were sent by our Lord Jesus, to spread the love of God to everyone we meet. We have not done that very well. In fact, many times, we have spread division, hate, guilt and shame instead of love, compassion, mercy, grace, forgiveness, or peace.\n\n\nI\u2019m very, very sorry about that.\nI hate to admit it, but the violence that your country is drowning in now is partly our fault. Not necessarily because we are the one\u2019s doing the violence, but because we have failed in our mission to preemptively transform this nation \u2013 and the world \u2013 with the irresistible love of Christ who lives within each and every one of us.\nYes, I know that sometimes we are the one\u2019s doing the violence, and sometimes we\u2019re cheering on those who torture, or drop bombs on innocents, but my apology is more specifically for the fact that we have failed to be agents of change in this world the way Jesus intended.\nI also know that we have done our fair share of \u201cgood\u201d in the world \u2013 funding homeless shelters, feeding the poor, caring for the unwed mothers and the orphans. Yes, those things are good, and I\u2019m glad some of us have made that a priority. But none of this good work makes up for our failure to love our enemies and promote peace.\nSee, instead of focusing all of our attention and time and energy on loving you \u2013 our neighbors \u2013 we have become endlessly distracted with a vast number of things that have nothing to do with our mission. We\u2019ve tried to manipulate the society using politics. We\u2019ve demonized other religions. We\u2019ve taken sides in political debates. We\u2019ve protected our own self-interests rather than lay down our lives so that the power of Christ might be revealed.\n\n\n\n\nSimply put, we have not acted very much like Jesus.\nI know that an apology doesn\u2019t change that fact. I know that the only thing that really makes any difference is when those of us who claim to follow the Prince of Peace actually begin to love the way He did, and serve others the way He did, and forgive the way He did, and love everyone unconditionally the way He did.\nI know that.\nNow, we\u2019re not going to shove it down your throat. We\u2019re not trying to force you to agree with us on any of that. But we do hope that you\u2019ll give us another chance to show you how wonderful Jesus really is, and how powerful His love can be, and how He can turn everyone \u2013 even the worst criminal and most violent offender \u2013 into the sort of person who brings real joy and life into the room, and\xa0who is full of grace and mercy.\nFor now, please forgive us for our miserable, embarrassing failure to put the unsearchable riches of Christ on display. This is our crime. This is our sin. We are truly sorry for this, and we\u2019re praying for another chance to get it right.\n\n\nI hope one day we can all make it up to you and that you\u2019ll find it in your heart to pardon us for missing the entire point of what Jesus came and died to set into motion.\nHis love really is transformative. He truly is someone worth getting to know. Please don\u2019t let us keep you from finding out for yourself. You might even discover that you\u2019re better at loving others than any of us are.\nSincerely,\nA concerned follower of Jesus.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

226,Why I Am Not Waiting For Jesus To Return,"December 3, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage: Pixabay\nEver since I first became a Christian at the age of 9 and gave my heart to Jesus, I have been told over and over again that Jesus is coming back soon.\nI watched those terrible films, you know the ones: \u201cThief in the Night\u201d, \u201cLeft Behind\u201d, and \u201cThe Late, Great Planet Earth\u201d.\n\n\nI read the books, including \u201c88 Reasons Why Christ Will Return in 1988\u201d and the sequel, \u201c89 Reasons Why Christ Will Return in 1989\u201d, which incidentally was exactly what it sounds like \u2013 the same book as the previous one but one one extra (wrong) reason.\nI remember as a young boy waking up in the middle of the night, terrified that Jesus had returned and left me alone in my house. I would get up and sneak over to my parent\u2019s room and place my ear on the door to see if I could hear them breathing and I could not return to bed again until I knew for certain that Jesus had not abandoned me.\nI have also been involved in countless conversations around the dinner table with family and friends who would, after a long list of everything that is wrong in this world, wag their heads and say, \u201cJesus, come soon\u201d or \u201cCome take us home, Lord!\u201d\nMaybe you can relate? Maybe you have also heard the mantra yourself repeated ad naseum \u201cJesus Is Coming Back Soon!\u201d or \u201cIt could be today!\u201d\nWell, I am sick of it.\nAs of now I am officially finished waiting for Jesus to come back.\nDoes that mean I don\u2019t believe in the Second Coming of Christ? No, it doesn\u2019t. But what it does mean is simply this: I am not waiting for Jesus to come back and fix things.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I have to come realize is that Jesus doesn\u2019t want us to wait for Him to return. He wants us to get busy being the light of the world and the salt of the earth. He wants us to be His ambassadors of His Kingdom in our community. He wants us to \u201cbe Christ\u201d to people around us who have never seen Him, or heard His voice. He wants us to be His hands and His feet to show compassion to people who don\u2019t deserve it, but so desperately need it anyway \u2013 just like us.\nWe need to stop looking up at the sky for a great rescue to take us out of this world. Instead, we need to bow our heads and pray that Jesus would come and live and breathe in us right now. We need to abide in Him \u2013 and Him in us \u2013 so that we can bear good fruit for His Kingdom.\nAnd if Jesus does return tomorrow, may He find us doing exactly what He told us to do: Loving and serving others as He has loved us.\nThe Body of Christ needs to wake up, come to life, and shine the light of Christ to a dark and hurting world that is so desperate for hope and genuine love and compassion.\nChrist is coming. Christ has come. He is alive in every one of us who have surrendered ourselves to Him.\n\n\nIf you keep sitting there waiting for Christ to return, you might get left behind.\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and \u201cThe Power of Weakness\u201d.

227,For The Love Of Your Pastor,"December 2, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage via Pixabay\n\xa0\nIn today\u2019s Christian landscape the senior pastor has become the single focus of ministry and church life. This one person is expected to perform every wedding and funeral, to baptize every new believer, to preside over every Lord\u2019s Supper, to teach and train and admonish and counsel and encourage every single member of his flock. He, or she, is also expected to oversee the finances, preach every Sunday morning and evening, and to guide the Church through whatever challenge might be facing them.\n\n\nIn effect, senior pastors are carrying the entire weight of the church on their shoulders. Some are lucky enough to have a staff supporting them, but even these associate pastors are overloaded with the burden of doing all the ministry for the youth, or the seniors, or the college students, or the young married couples, etc.\nIn my own spiritual life, I\u2019ve personally been very blessed by many dear servants of God who had surrendered to full-time, pastoral ministry.\nIn fact, I\u2019ve been one of those who served as a pastor myself, and I honestly believe that most who enter the pastorate do so out of a genuine desire to follow Christ and to use their spiritual gifts to edify the rest of the Body of Christ.\nBut as we examine the statistics for pastors in American churches the results are frightening. According to Focus on the Family, Ministries Today, Charisma Magazine, TNT Ministries, and other respected groups:\n\n1,500 pastors leave the ministry permanently each month in America.\n4,000 new churches start each year in America.\n7,000 churches close each year in America.\n50% of pastors\u2019 marriages end in divorce.\n70% of pastors continually battle depression.\n80% of pastors and 85% of their spouses feel discouraged in their roles.\n95% of pastors do not regularly pray with their spouses.\n70% of pastors do not have a close friend, confidant, or mentor.\n50% of pastors are so discouraged they would leave the ministry if they could but have no other way to make a living.\n\n\n\nThese statistics mirror what Moses felt like when he was struggling with leading nearly a million people after the exodus from Egypt. He cried out to the Lord saying:\n\u201cI cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me. If this is how you are going to treat me, put me to death right now\u2014if I have found favor in your eyes\u2014and do not let me face my own ruin.\u201d (Numbers 11:14-15)\nIn response, God calls Moses to choose seventy elders from among the people, on whom He will pour out His Spirit and empower for ministry to the people. After this Moses says,\n\u201cI wish that all the LORD\u2019s people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!\u201d (Numbers 11:29)\nThis prophetic cry from Moses is repeated when the prophet Joel reveals that God\u2019s plan is to do just that:\n\u201cI will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions. Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days.\u201d (Joel 2:28-29)\nWhen was this promise completed? In the book of Acts, at the feast of Pentecost God did exactly this.\n\n\nJesus was the fulfillment of the shadow found in the Old Covenant priesthood. He is now our only High Priest.\nJesus was the fulfillment of the shadow of the sacrificial lamb who takes away our sins. We no longer require a Levitical priesthood to offer sacrifices.\nJesus was the fulfillment of the shadow of the temple. \u201cOne greater than the temple has come,\u201d Jesus said in Matthew 12:6. At his crucifixion, God tore the veil in the temple in two, from top to bottom to signify the end of that old covenant temple system \u2013 the priests, the animal sacrifice, the temple itself are all now superfluous and unnecessary.\nWhy did Jesus do all of this? So that you and I could become the living sacrifice (Romans 12). So that we could become the priesthood of believers (1 Peter 2:4-10). So that you and I could become the new, living temple of the Holy Spirit.\n\u201cIt was never in the mind of God that a privileged priesthood of sinful, imperfect men would attempt, following the death and triumphant resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, to repair the veil and continue their office of mediation between God and man. The letter to the Hebrews makes that fact very plain. When Jesus rose from the dead, the Levitical priesthood, which had served Israel under the Old Covenant, became redundant.\u201d \u2013 A. W.Tozer\n\n\n\n\nActually, it was never God\u2019s plan to have His New Covenant Church operate like a Levitical priesthood. Jesus commanded His disciples not to emulate the top-down organizational structures of either the Jewish religion (Matt 23:8-12), or of the Pagan authorities (Mark 10:42-45). Instead, He urged them to treat one another as brothers and as equals.\nPaul, in 1 Corinthians, chapter 12, outlines God\u2019s plan for the Church to operate as a Body. In this New Testament model, Jesus is the only one in control and the people within the Church are empowered \u2013 each and every one of them \u2013 by the Holy Spirit to minister to one another.\n\u201cNow to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.\u201d (1 Cor 12:7)\nNotice how each of these various gifts are distributed to the Body, by the Holy\nSpirit for a single purpose: \u201cfor the common good.\u201d God does this so that everyone in the Body is necessary and so that everyone contributes and shares the burden of ministry.\n\u201cAll these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines.\u201d (1 Cor 12:11)\nNotice how it doesn\u2019t say, \u201c..he gives them to ONE PERSON\u201d but that these gifts are given to \u201ceach one\u201d of the members of the Body.\n\n\n\u201cThe body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ.\u201d (1 Cor 12:12)\nNotice how the body is a reflection of Christ himself if we operate as a unit made up of many parts all working together under the headship of Christ. The implication is that if we do not function as God designed, we are not reflecting Christ to the world.\n\u201cFor we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body\u2014whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free\u2014and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.\u201d (1 Cor 12:13)\nNotice how throughout 1 Corinthians chapter 12 the emphasis is not on one particular member but on the entire Body itself. This is especially significant when you consider that this church in Corinth was probably one of the most troubled and morally challenged churches in early Christian history. Even so, Paul never abandons the shared body ministry in order to correct these errors. He never commands their elders to take control and whip people into shape. He never addresses the senior pastor at all in this letter, or any other letter. Why? Because there wasn\u2019t one.\nThe overwhelming evidence throughout the New Testament is that every baptized believer in Christ was automatically ordained by the Holy Spirit into the ministry of Jesus. There was no separation between clergy and laity.\n\n\nWere there some within the Body who were gifted to teach and to encourage and to lead? Yes, of course. But the entire life of the Church did not revolve around these few. Instead, every single believer was empowered to contribute and to speak and to use their gifting as the Holy Spirit directed.\nAccording to the New Testament, when the Church actually becomes a real Body, and when Jesus is really the only Shepherd, the entire Body will be healthy and operate as God actually intended all along.\nHow can we continually refer to ourselves as \u201cThe Body of Christ\u201d if we do not actually engage in the organic form of shared life as described in 1 Corinthians 12?\nIf you really love your pastors, the best thing you can do for them is to encourage them to stop trying to carry all of the weight of the entire Body on their own shoulders. Pray that the Church will return to a New Testament model as God originally intended. Pray that we would affirm with Peter that God has indeed answered the prayer of Moses and the promise in Joel to pour out His Spirit on all flesh so that every member of the Body of Christ can serve and love one another in love.\n-kg\n\xa0\n\n\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He is also the co-founder of Pacifist Fight Club and co-host of \u201cThe Heretic Happy Hour\u201d Podcast.\xa0\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/12/for-the-love-of-your-pastor/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian

229,Our Cultural Blindspots,"November 30, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage via Pixabay\nNOTE: Recently, my friend Dr. Scott Bartchy \u2013 Professor Emeritus of Christian Origins and History of Religion at UCLA \u2013 sent me two documents to examine. Both of them contained more than enough insight to fill up this blog for the next few months. This blog is one of many to come based on these new insights.\n\n\n**\nDue to our own lack of awareness about first-century Jewish culture, we have been blinded to several key nuances found in the New Testament texts.\nAs Bartchy points out, \u201cTheir values are not our values. Unless we learn otherwise, both professional exegetes and na\xefve readers naturally assume that our own social experiences and the cultural values with which we were raised have been generally characteristic of socially-approved human life across time and space. Regrettably, this assumption has encouraged readers\u2026to interpret our ancient (NT) documents in ways that ignore or misunderstand the prevailing structures of fundamental human relationships in Jesus\u2019 social world.\u201d\nHe then goes on to point out that these areas of misunderstanding include concepts like kinship, marriage, patriarchy, and manliness.\nHis paper, \u201cJesus, The Pharisees and Mediterranean Manliness\u201d \u2013 which is scheduled to appear as chapter 16 in a book entitled \u201cTeaching the Historical Jesus: Issues and Exegesis\u201d, edited by Zev Gerber \u2013 goes on to masterfully demonstrate how several of Jesus\u2019 commands and teachings are typically misunderstood by modern commentators and Bible teachers. The main reason for this blind spot, he says, is our lack of understanding the \u201cShame/Honor\u201d values inherent within first-century Jewish culture.\n\n\nThe tension that arises between Jesus and the Pharisees, Bartchy says, is primarily caused by Jesus\u2019 subversive teachings and actions that seek to undermine the prevailing culture of the day, which the Pharisees were deeply entangled with.\nIn this shame/honor culture, Jesus seeks to redefine what makes for honor and shame in His Father\u2019s Kingdom, or \u201cWhen God rules all things\u201d.\nIn short, Bartchy\u2019s point is this: The way the Pharisees \u2013 and every other male in the first century \u2013 behaved was\xa0normal behavior.\xa0When they sat at the place of honor at the table, it was what they were all trained to do since birth. When they asked their Rabbi if they could be given the honor to sit by his side, this was totally acceptable. When they sought to be recognized by others for their wisdom or authority, this was how everything was supposed to be.\nSimply put, the first-century Jewish culture of Jesus\u2019 day was based on shame and honor. Males were trained early on to bring honor to themselves \u2013 and therefore to their family name \u2013 at all costs. They were also trained to avoid being shamed for the same reasons. Every male of Jesus\u2019 day was either working to be seen as honored or striving to avoid being placed in a position of shame.\n\n\nWhen we see Jesus rebuking the Pharisees flaunting their honor in the marketplace and praying in public, for example. This is what everyone in that culture would have expected them to do. It was not seen by anyone at that time as prideful, arrogant or rude. That is, not by anyone other than Jesus, of course.\nJesus shows up and right away challenges this status quo. It was Jesus who was seen as rude for condemning these men of honor for behaving normally. It was Jesus who was seen as behaving oddly when he rebuked the Pharisees for inviting honorable people to their banquets rather than the lame, the blind, the poor and the sick.\nJesus was the one that everyone in that culture would have perceived as being rude, arrogant and yes, possibly even prideful. Or at least they would have seen him as someone who had little authority to point to those who had honor and claim that in reality, they had none.\n\u201cThe goal of male socialization,\u201d says Bartchy, \u201c(was) to add honor to the family name. (Because) honor was by far the most highly prized possession. How much honor anyone deserved depended on one\u2019s peers\u2019 perception and their public acknowledgment of one\u2019s authority, gender status, and reputation.\u201d\n\n\n \n\nBartchy goes on to describe two forms of honor in this early culture: Ascribed honor and Acquired honor. The honor inherited from one\u2019s family was the ascribed honor one was born into. The honor one might receive by competing with other men in the culture was acquired honor. Both were very important to have and to cultivate.\n\u201cThus, seeking greater honor for oneself and one\u2019s family was the fundamental life task of every adult male, and traditional male socialization produced human beings who were programmed to pursue a neverending quest for greater honor and influence,\u201d says Bartchy.\nIt is in this context that Jesus\u2019 words to his disciples \u2013 \u201cwhoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant\u201d \u2013 rang out like nails scraping loudly down the world\u2019s longest chalkboard.\n\u201cThe vast majority of commentators\u2026have ignored the cultural appropriateness (when James and John ask to sit at Jesus\u2019 side in the Kingdom) seeking honor,\u201d he says.\nAs a result, most everyone has missed the incredible forcefulness of Jesus\u2019 teaching as it cut against the grain of acceptable masculinity in the first century Mediterranean cultures.\n\n\nOne also must take into account how little of this honor Jesus himself had \u2013 from both ascribed and acquired varieties: The identity of his birth father was questionable. His family standing was automatically in doubt due to where he had grown up (\u201cCan anything good come out of Nazareth?\u201d John 1:46).\nNormally, a young male in this situation \u2013 with so little ascribed honor \u2013 would feel immense pressure to work for acquired honor in the eyes of everyone around him. \u201cYet\u2026rather than seeking honor for himself,\u201d Bartchy notes, \u201cJesus was prepared to be humiliated rather than to compete for honor and play the traditional male game of one-upmanship.\u201d\nBeyond this, Jesus went further to teach his own disciples to ascribe honor to others and to work to help those without honor to acquire it.\nWith all of this in mind, listen as Jesus stands on the mount to preach a sermon that proclaims honor upon those who are humble, and those who give comfort to others, and those who practice mercy, and those who make peace. Listen as Jesus defies the honor-seeking culture of His day to declare that God only honors those who have none, and those who don\u2019t want any, and those who only work to bring honor to those people around them who will never, ever earn \u2013 or even deserve \u2013 honor in their own society.\n\n\nBartchy also points out that one New Testament scholar, K.C. Hanson, \u201cforged a major breakthrough in understanding the famous \u2018Beatitudes\u2019\u2026when he applied his knowledge of both ancient Mediterranean cultural values and Hebrew and Greek philology to his translation of the Greek word \u201cmacharios\u201d (traditionally rendered \u201cblessed\u201d)\u2026(as) \u201chonored.\u201d\nTherefore, Jesus\u2019 words, \u201cHonored are the merciful. Honored are the poor.\u201d Etc. take on new and fantastic implications for us. Now we see that Jesus is rewriting the rules and creating a brand new set of cultural values that stand in direct contrast to those considered normative in his day. By saying that the poor are honored, and the peacemakers are honored, Jesus is saying that God uses a totally different set of values for deciding who receives the honor and who receives shame. God\u2019s Kingdom honors the humble, not the proud. His Kingdom honors the poor and the outcast, not the rich and the influential.\nWhat must be stressed is that there is nothing specifically \u201cPharisaical\u201d about seeking honor for oneself during Jesus\u2019 day. Everyone operated under these rules. It was the status quo and no one questioned it.\n\n\nNo one except Jesus, that is.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon best-seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politicst To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/our-cultural-blindspots/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
230,Jesus Is The Son of God (And So Am I),"November 29, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nPhoto credit: Dina McMillan\nMost Christians are convinced that Jesus is the Son of God. But not as many are convinced that they are also the son (or daughter) of God, even though the New Testament goes out of its way to stress this fact.\nFor example:\n\n\n\u201cYet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.\u201d (John 1:12)\n\u201cIt is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?\u201d (Hebrews 12:7)\n\u201cSee what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!\u201d (1 John 3:1)\n\u201cFor those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God\u2019s children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs\u2014heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.\u201d (Romans 8:14-17)\n\u201cI will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.\u201d (2 Cor. 6:18; 2 Sam. 7:14)\n\u201cBut when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship. Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \u201cAbba, Father.\u201d So you are no longer a slave, but God\u2019s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.\u201d (Galatians 4:4-7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\nSo, as I\u2019ve been meditating on this lately it\u2019s started to make me wonder: How would the son of God treat his co-workers? How should the son of God interact with his neighbors? How might we expect the son of God to drive his car? Or wait in line at the grocery store? Or respond to a homeless person?\nSee what I mean? The idea that you and I are the sons and daughters of God is quite transformative, and I believe that is the entire point.\nJust try going through your day with the awareness that you are the son (or daughter) of God and see how it changes what you say, how you act and what you do.\nNow, try doing this for a week, or a month, or maybe even the rest of your life.\nI\u2019d love to hear how it goes!\n\nWATCH: Keith explains this concept a little further in this short video clip:\n\n\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon best-seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d\xa0\n\n\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/jesus-son-god/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
231,What If No One Had A Bible?,"November 27, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nTry to imagine it: No Bibles anywhere. No King James. No NIV. Not even a paperback copy of \u201cThe Message\u201d.\nWhat would that be like?\n\xa0\nImage via Pixabay\n\xa0\n\xa0\nRegardless of how such a thing might happen, try to imagine what it would be like to never have access to the Bible \u2013 ever again.\n\n\nIn some ways, I think our world might actually be a better place if no one had a Bible anymore.\xa0\nMaybe if we didn\u2019t depend on a book for everything we\u2019d start to discover an inner desperation and a hunger for a deeper experience of Jesus.\nNot only that, if there were no Bibles, we just might start to value listening to one another share testimonies of Jesus. Especially if there was no more need to hear from the resident Bible expert or scholar talk for an hour every weekend.\nImagine sitting in your living room with friends and listening to people share what Jesus was saying or doing in their lives that week. Imagine someone closing their eyes and quoting verses about how nothing can separate us from the love of God, or about how Jesus died for us while we were still enemies of God?\nDon\u2019t you think this might help us to connect with one another \u2013 and with Jesus \u2013 more directly?\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one, but the more I think about this the more convinced I am that we might just be better off without our Bibles.\nNow, I get it. I\u2019m talking about what it would be like to first learn what the Bible says and study it and memorize it before experiencing those words in a deeper and more intimate way.\n\n\n\n\nBut, what if we only had our memories of scripture to sustain us? What if we could only pass on to our children the verses that really spoke deeply to us? What verses would we choose?\nProbably verses where Jesus says, \u201cFather forgive them, for they know not what they do\u201d and \u201cLove one another as I have loved you\u201d would dominate your memory.\nPerhaps you\u2019d want your children to remember certain Parables that Jesus shared, like the Prodigal Son, or the Treasure in the Field or the Sower of Seeds.\nChances are you probably wouldn\u2019t find it all that crucial to memorize verses where God commanded His people to slaughter every man, woman, and child and warned them not to show any compassion while doing so. You might leave behind the verses about how blessed those people are who dash infants against the rocks.\nThat, to me, would be a very good thing.\nIf all we had left was Jesus and our memories of scriptures that really touched us and profoundly changed us, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\nWhat do you think?\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon best-seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/no-one-bible/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
232,Jesus Returns Today,"November 26, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage via Pixabay\nNot only am I really tired of all the so-called end times prophets picking dates for the End of the World based on some obscure Bible passage, a few wonky mathematical equations, the alignment of the moon and the stars and a little bit of old-fashioned B.S. thrown in for good measure, I\u2019m downright angry about it.\n\n\nI mean, I can\u2019t decide what\u2019s worse: The fact that these sorts of predictions continually get promoted or that so many Christians endlessly fall for them.\nWhat it does for our faith is to solidly prove to everyone who has never read the Bible that it must assuredly be too confusing to understand, or just flat-out filled with failed prophecies.\nEither way, these end times prophecies about the end of the world based loosely on the Bible do nothing but make Christians look stupid and the Bible look untrustworthy.\nWhy would anyone listen to anything a Christian says about anything? If they can\u2019t even understand their own Holy Book, what makes us think they can understand my life, or help me with my problems, or lead me to something one might consider to be \u201cThe Truth\u201d?\nWith all that being said, I have something to say to all of you:\nJesus returns today.\nI\u2019m totally serious.\nToday, Jesus will reveal Himself as the Lord and show His true power to the world.\n\n\nEvery knee will bow when they see Him.\nEvery tongue will confess when they hear His voice.\nEvery heart will melt like wax when they realize that they are in the Presence of the Holy One.\nHis Kingdom will descend from Heaven.\nHis rule and reign will have no end.\n\n\nJesus returns today.\nHere\u2019s how: You and I are carriers of His Presence.\nHis Spirit lives and breathes within every one of us.\nThere are millions of us all over the world right now.\nThose of us who are in Christ will not only do the things that Jesus did \u2013 feed the hungry, care for the sick, stand for the oppressed \u2013 but we will do even greater things than this.\nLike, love our enemies and pray for those who hate us.\nLike, forgive those who have spitefully used us and release them \u2013 and ourselves \u2013 from prisons of pain and regret.\n\n\nLike, serving our neighbors and demonstrating the transformative love of Jesus in every way we possibly can.\nWhen people who have not known Jesus see this kind of love, they will see Him and they will be conquered by His affection.\nWhen people who have never experienced forgiveness are set free from blame and guilt, they will experience His presence and be overcome with joy.\nWhen people who have been told they do not deserve love and compassion are suddenly and unexpectedly immersed and saturated by the love of Christ that is higher, and wider, and longer, and deeper than any mind can comprehend, they will know that Jesus has returned to rescue them.\nJesus is returning today.\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you just might catch a glimpse of Him when He does.\nIf not, that\u2019s ok. He\u2019ll be returning tomorrow, too.\nBut, whatever you do, don\u2019t get left behind.\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon best-seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/jesus-returns-today/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
233,Someone To Rule Over Us,"November 25, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage via Pixabay\nIt\u2019s one of the saddest statements in the entire Bible. When God tells the prophet that His people are rejecting Him as their King, you can almost hear God\u2019s heartbreak.\nGod\u2019s original design was for us to be His people and for God to be our King. That\u2019s the way it was from the time God called His people out of Egypt and led them through the wilderness and into the Promised Land that He had prepared for them.\n\n\nBut eventually, they rejected Him as their King, saying \u201cWe want a King like all the other nations of the earth have.\u201d\nAt first, God\u2019s prophet felt rejected because he was the main voice of God to the people, but when he reported this news to God [as if He didn\u2019t already know the hearts of His own people], God\u2019s response was clear: \u201cThey are not rejecting you. They are rejecting me.\u201d\nAnd God\u2019s heart broke.\nBut He also promised to establish a New Covenant with His people; one where that original design was re-established. As God put it:\n\u201cThe days are coming,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cwhen I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.\xa0\n\u201cIt will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt,\xa0because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them,\u201d declares the Lord.\n\u201cThis is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,\u201d declares the Lord.\n \u201cI will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.\u201d\xa0[Jeremiah 31:31-33]\n\n\n\xa0\nIn other words, God was promising to bring everything back into the shape it was always meant to be in. He would be our God, our King, and we would be His people. No longer would we seek to place another human being over us. Never again would God\u2019s people seek out a surrogate for Him. We would have direct access to the King, with an open invitation to boldly approach His throne of Grace at any time.\nGod would invite us to call Him \u201cAbba\u201d or \u201cDaddy\u201d. He would call us friends, not servants. Our allegiance and loyalty would be to God, and to Him alone. He would be our King. Our hearts would not desire \u201ca King like all the other nations have\u201d because our King would be God Himself.\n\xa0\nThis is the very same covenant that Jesus confirmed with His disciples before His arrest and crucifixion. It\u2019s the same new covenant that we celebrate every time we eat the bread and drink the cup together. It\u2019s a covenant with God where His rule and reign over us is re-established and confirmed. Under the New Covenant, God is once again our King. Jesus is proclaimed as our \u201cLord\u201d which means He is our ruler.\n\n\xa0\nYet some today are returning again to that same practice of shrugging off the rule and reign of God as their King.\n\n\n\n\nThey DO want a new king. In fact, they\u2019re crying out for a human leader \u201clike all the other nations have\u201d who can give them what they want: power, safety, security, prosperity, and respect.\nJust listen to what the pastor of the oldest megachurch in America\xa0just said\xa0about the kind of leader he wants to rule over him:\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m looking for a leader who\u2019s going to fight ISIS and keep this nation secure,\xa0I don\u2019t want some meek and mild leader or somebody who\u2019s going to turn the other cheek.\xa0I\u2019ve said I want the meanest, toughest SOB I can find to protect this nation.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not alone.\nMany more Christians in this nation want a leader to rule over them who is just as tough, and as violent, as possible. They don\u2019t want someone like Jesus as their King. They want a leader, \u201clike all the other nations of the earth\u201d.\nAnd whether they know it or not, they have rejected God \u2013 even His son, Jesus \u2013 as their King.\n\n\xa0The earliest Christians understood this. They knew that Jesus stood as a rival to Caesar. They went to their deaths because they refused to say \u201cCaesar Is Lord!\u201d and instead cried out defiantly: \u201cWe have no King but Jesus!\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce Constantine corrupted the faith by wedding the Church to the State, that all changed. Suddenly Caesar appeared to be on our side. Being a Christian didn\u2019t necessarily mean that Christ alone was King.\n\nAlmost overnight, the people of God said once again, \u201cWe don\u2019t want God to rule over us anymore. We want a King like all the other nations have.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because now Caesar was promising to protect them, to give them power, to offer them prestige, and comfort, and security.\n\xa0Sound familiar?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to remember what the New Covenant was really all about? Maybe we need to remember that Jesus came as a King, to establish an eternal Kingdom where His people would submit to His rule and reign in their actual lives?\nMaybe we need to say, along with those early Christians \u201cWe have no King but Jesus!\u201d and \u201cWe have no Caesar but Christ!\u201d\nMaybe\u2026\n**\n\nKeith Giles is the author of the Amazon best-seller,\xa0\u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/someone-rule-us/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
234,Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb,"November 23, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\n\xa0\nPhoto via Pixabay\nPolitical Tribalism in America Is Unbearably Toxic.\nChristians in America are oblivious to the way their political entanglement and tribalism have led them away from Jesus and into the heart of darkness.\n\n\nIt started a long time ago. As Princeton historian Kevin Kruse details in his book,\xa0\u201cOne Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America,\u201d our country\u2019s religious prostitution began in the 1950\u2019s. That was when, as Kruse explains, business leaders plotted to link Christianity, Republican politics, and libertarian economics tightly together.\nWhy? Simply to create a feeling of solidarity between Christians and Corporations who might both see \u201cBig Government\u201d as a common enemy.\nThis is where our national motto, \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d (1956), and a new line in the Pledge of Allegiance was added: \u201cOne nation under God\u201d (1954) came from.\nTheir goal was simple: To entangle Christianity with Republican politics in order to benefit big business.\nSimply put: It worked.\nOn a national level, it\u2019s even worse. We no longer have a Government by the people, for the people, and of the people. Instead, corporations have been legally redefined as people and laws are passed that benefit those corporations, regardless of whether or not the American people want those laws or benefit from them. And most often they do not benefit at all but pay a hefty price.\n\n\nPolitical corruption is legal in America.\nThis entanglement of our faith with politics is pervasive. It has saturated our identity.\nMany Christian leaders and pastors vocally support candidates that a few years ago would have been shunned for their shameful behaviors. But today those politicians are embraced so that the Republican party can gain power and maintain dominance in the House or the Senate.\nNow, Republicans seek to dissolve the Johnson Amendment which was put in place over 60 years ago to ensure that charitable organizations \u2013 including Christian churches \u2013 remain non-partisan. Over 4,000 faith leaders recently voiced their support for keeping the Johnson Amendment in place. So, why are politicians interested in having it repealed?\nSo that Christian Churches can more openly endorse political candidates and the entanglement of faith and politics in America can continue.\nWho does this benefit? It benefits political parties, not the Church.\nAs three different Christian pastors in Houston recently said:\n\n\n\u201cIn our more than 50 years of pastoring churches, we have never shied away from preaching about controversial issues. Nor has the inability of our churches to endorse a candidate prevented any of us in any way from testifying before the city council, writing op-eds or raising our voices in other ways on social issues. Giving our congregations a theological lens through which to view the issues of the day does not require coming anywhere close to the church endorsing a candidate for political office.\u201d \nIn their summary, these same Christian pastors noted:\n\u201cChurches, however, are not partisan institutions. Mixing churches and partisanship is a bit like mixing ice cream and manure: No one ever thinks less of the manure.\u201c\nThankfully, many Christians are waking up to the dangers of entanglement, including conservative political columnist Dana Hall McCain who said:\n\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s where we are: the GOP has come to understand that Evangelicals are trained seals. We show up and clap for any clown you can slap a Republican jersey on. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a godly or wise person. Our votes are a sure thing, and we\u2019ll turn out and vote for problematic or corrupt GOP candidates far more consistently than non-religious conservatives. So come to terms with the fact that the church isn\u2019t influencing diddly squat, not even in our favorite party. To the contrary, the church is the one being influenced \u2014 and our credibility before a lost and dying world destroyed \u2014 because we have believed the great lie about political engagement.\n\n\nWe have all the power in the world, but we lack the faith to exercise it. They own us, because we don\u2019t trust God enough to call the bluff.\u201d\nShe\u2019s right: Christians already have \u201call the power in the world\u201d and it\u2019s called \u201cThe Gospel.\u201d We have simply abandoned that power to transform hearts and minds from the inside-out and traded it for legislative power to govern from the top-down.\nThe entanglement of Christianity and Conservative Politics is now fully realized. Many Christians in America cannot separate their faith from their politics. They are more American than Christian. They cannot imagine following Jesus apart from political action or influence via their political party.\nThose on the outside of our faith cannot see the difference between our faith and our politics either. This is probably one of the more damaging aspects of our entanglement. Christianity, to a non-Christian, looks more like a political party, not a way of loving our neighbors or following the teachings of Jesus.\nBecause American Christianity has become so completely entangled with Conservative Republican politics, we have become impotent and irrelevant. Thousands of people are leaving the faith because they are sick of this political entanglement. They want Jesus and we give them politics. They want to follow Christ and we want to follow a political ideology. Until we abandon one, we cannot fully embrace the other. Or, as one wise man once put it: \u201cYou cannot serve two masters. You will hate one or love the other.\u201d\n\n\nThe simple truth is this: You can\u2019t convert a system if that system has already converted you.\nToday\u2019s Christians are hopelessly entangled in partisan politics. Since we are more American and Republican than Christ-like, we cannot convert anyone to Christianity until we repent of our tribalism.\nTribalism is what leads us to hate someone for their political affiliation. It\u2019s what empowers us to divide the Body of Christ over which candidates we like, even though Paul the Apostle wouldn\u2019t allow Christians in Corinth to divide over which Apostle was their favorite.\nUntil Christians in America can untangle themselves from politics and honestly say that they have no King but Jesus, the Gospel will remain un-preached and worse, un-lived.\nThere is a way to save this nation, but it\u2019s not a political solution. Until we wake up and realize that, we will continue to be manipulated by tribalism and traitors to our one true Nation, which is the Kingdom of God.\nCrucify your politics and pledge allegiance to the Lamb while you can.\nThe time is short.\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of the Amazon best-seller, \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/crucifying-our-politics/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian

236,God Does Not Have A Penis,"November 22, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\n\n\xa0\nSeveral years ago I was writing a column for Relevant Magazine called \u201cSubversive\u201d which featured interviews from various voices in the Emerging Church Movement.\nOne of those voices was Spencer Burke. He not only helped to launch an emerging church here in Orange County, but he also started an online magazine called theOoze.com and also wrote a great book called \u201cMaking Sense of Church\u201d.\n\n\nThat\u2019s why one afternoon about twelve years ago I was sitting across the table from him in Newport Beach, California interviewing him for Relevant.\nBut that\u2019s when he said something that made me second guess the entire interview. He said, \u201cJust imagine, if the Jewish culture had been Matriarchal instead of Patriarchal, God would have been \u2018Mother\u2019 and Jesus could have been a woman.\u201d\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t know what to say to any of that. I was just so far outside my comfort zone at the time. Spencer is seriously one of the few people I have ever met that I would sincerely call a genius. He has an astounding gift to predict where the culture is headed and he has an insight about human nature that is uncanny.\nStill, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with that statement. On the one hand, I didn\u2019t want to edit out that quote because I knew Spencer would notice that I had left it off the article. But I also didn\u2019t want to publish it and have it hurt Spencer\u2019s reputation.\nSo, I never published the interview at all.\nThat was over a decade ago. Since then my theology has radically shifted. I owe Spencer an apology for not having the courage to publish his statement which, today, seems so obvious and true.\n\n\nHere\u2019s the deal: God is not male.God is not female. God does not have a gender.\nWe use the pronoun \u201cHe\u201d for several reasons. One, because we don\u2019t want to call God an \u201cIt\u201d. God is a person and therefore has a personality. Two, because a patriarchal society tends to fashion their Deity in the male image. In other words, God made us in His image and then we returned the favor by making God into an image that reflects ourselves.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the common use of the term \u201cHe\u201d to refer to God creates the illusion that God is male. But that is not the case.\nGod is Spirit. God is not male. God is not female. When the Genesis account tells us that mankind was made in the image of God that means that men and women were both made in His image. The man was created first, yes, but hidden within that man was the female. Therefore, both man and woman were the \u201cimage of God\u201d that was created. One was hidden inside the other, but both were created to reflect the image of God.\nYes, the male aspect of God gets more screen time than the female one, but there are several images of God as female that \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 have been overlooked throughout Church history.\n\n\nBut they are there.\nFor example, when Jesus stands up on the last day of the Feast and invites everyone to \u201ccome to me and drink\u201d the picture is of a mother nursing her young. [See John 7:37] This image is repeated when Jesus weeps over Jerusalem on Palm Sunday and says that he longs \u201cto gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wing.\u201d [See Luke 13:34]\nThere are many other verses in the Old Testament Hebrew scriptures that speak of God as \u201cgiving birth\u201d to Israel and uses metaphors where God nurses them and cares for them like a Mother cares for her children. The New Testament scriptures often speak of us as being \u201cborn of God\u201d and \u201cchildren of God\u201d who are nurtured on milk as newborn babes in Christ.\nSo, while we may be accustomed to calling God \u201cHe\u201d it is not blasphemous or inappropriate to call God \u201cShe\u201d or to alternate between the two because, as I\u2019ve said before: God does not have a penis, or a vagina.\nGod is a Spirit and those who worship God do so in Spirit and in Truth.\n-kg\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d.

237,What If Jesus Could Be You For 24 Hours?,"November 21, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nDallas Willard always expresses discipleship to Jesus as \u201cLiving your life as he would live it if he were you.\u201d So, maybe I was meditating on this too much the night before. Whatever it was, here\u2019s what happened in my dream.\nAfter getting dressed in my clothes, Jesus adjusted my best tie in the bathroom mirror and picked up my briefcase.\nImage via Pixaby\n\u201cI\u2019ll be home in time for dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cEnjoy your day off.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said.\nJesus jingled my car keys in his hand as he strolled down the sidewalk and got into my car.\nDoes he know how to drive a stick? I wondered. But, he started the car and drove it out of the driveway with no problem.\nAs I stood there in my pajamas looking at the car disappear into the distance, I wondered what he\u2019d do at my work in my place. What sorts of trouble might I be in tomorrow?\nWhen Jesus got home it was late. My car wasn\u2019t in the driveway. \u201cI took the bus home,\u201d he said.\nAs he sat down to tell me about his day as me I notice that my wristwatch was missing from his arm. I was afraid to ask him what had happened to it.\nFirst Jesus explained why he hadn\u2019t brought my car back. \u201cThere was this homeless woman at the stoplight near your work,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has two small children and her husband left her two years ago.\u201d\nI finally got the nerve to ask him what happened to my car and he responded matter of factly, \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me any money, so I gave her your car. You should have seen the look of joy in her eyes.\u201d\nI remembered avoiding eye-contact with that woman the last few weeks. I wasn\u2019t even interested in rolling down my window to drop a few dollars into the bucket she was holding. Now she was out driving around in my car. What would I tell my insurance agent?\n\n\nThen Jesus went on to explain how, once he got to my cubicle at work, he began to hammer out those monotonous spreadsheets that were due on Friday instead of checking email and surfing the web for the first 35 minutes of the day. \u201cI got done about ten minutes before the coffee break,\u201d he beamed.\nAt break time, instead of slipping outside to eat a Snickers or smoke a cigarette, Jesus walked down the row to visit Charlie, the quiet guy at work that nobody ever talks to. At first, I wasn\u2019t sure who Charlie was, but as he began to describe the guy I start to remember him. He was a weird guy I\u2019d never bothered to talk with before.\n\n\n\u201cI told him not to be discouraged. He\u2019s been considering a divorce, but I reminded him of those early days when he and his wife first fell in love. I think he might be willing to try and love her more, in spite of the way she treats him sometimes. We prayed together before I left,\u201d he said.\nThe rest of the day, Jesus tells me, he flew through my workload, returned all my old email messages, and got twice as much accomplished as I ever had.\n\u201cI really wanted to do a good job,\u201d he explained, \u201cSo your boss would know how thankful you are to have a job. I think he was beginning to doubt how dependable and hard-working you were. Character is such as lost art these days,\u201d he said. I nodded along as he spoke and tried to sit up straight in my chair.\n\n\n\u201cOn the bus ride home,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cI met an old woman whose Grandson had just been diagnosed with HIV. At first, she went on about his filthy lifestyle and how he got what he deserved.\u201d\nJesus stopped suddenly and I thought he was about to cry.\nI asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat is?\u201d\nHe looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, \u201cTo get what you deserve.\u201d\nAfter drying his eyes, Jesus continued with his story. \u201cI reminded her of those early days when her Grandson was a small boy, and then I asked her to share her fondest memories of him as a toddler.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to die soon,\u201d Jesus said. \u201cI wanted her to give him the grace he needs before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nAfter a few moments, Jesus composed himself and stood to go. I offered him some dinner but he shook his head and said, \u201cNo thanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fasting.\u201d\nBefore he left, Jesus looked into my eyes with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve had quite a day with me in your shoes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should do this again sometime.\u201d\nThen Jesus handed me a small box. \u201cI made this gift for you,\u201d he said.\n\n\nWhen he left, I opened it. It was a small bracelet that said, \u201cWhat Will You Do?\u201d\nThen I woke up.\n**\nKeith Giles\nNOTE: Taken from the book, \u201cNobody Follows Jesus (So Why Should You?)\u201d by Keith Giles.\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/jesus-24-hours/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
238,My Personal Mission Statement,"November 20, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nImage via Pixabay\n\n\nAs part of my new job, we\u2019re encouraged to read through the book, \u201c7 Habits of Highly Effective People\u201d and reflect on each of the habits together in scheduled weekly meetings.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s not something I would ever want to do on my own as I am allergic to all the usual leadership and success-minded literature that permeates our culture. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how many of the principles are derived from the teachings of Jesus.\n\nFor example, the first habit involves realizing that we often allow others to control us. The goal is to move from being reactionary \u2013 where we are always being manipulated by the desires of others \u2013 to being proactive \u2013 where we are driven more by our own set of internal values. In other words, our attitudes should not be shaped by circumstances or people, but by an inward decision to be who we already are, regardless of our circumstance.\n\nSo, my joy is not dependent upon outward conditions: how much money I have, or how many people like me, or what sort of status I may have in society. Instead, my joy radiates from within and flows out of who I am inside. Because I know I am loved by God, created in His image, called by His name and adopted into His family as His child and co-heir with Christ, my happiness is fixed on this.\n\n\n\nI can be in prison, or sitting under a tree in the park and I am content. I can be rich or poor, young or old, healthy or sick and still remain at peace within myself based on who I am inside.\n\nThis is what Paul referred to when he said that he had:\xa0\u201c\u2026learned to be content whatever the circumstances.\xa0I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty.\xa0I have learned the secret of being content\xa0in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.\xa0I can do all this through him who gives me strength.\u201d (Philippians 4:11-13)\nThe second habit is to start with the end in mind. Literally, this means to begin by imagining your own funeral. Who is there?\xa0 What do they say about you? What do you want them to say? In other words, if you want people to stand and say that you were a great friend, that means you\u2019ll need to start being a great friend. If you hope that people will talk about what a loving and kind person you are, then you should start working now on being more loving and kind to people.\n\nAgain, this concept is very grounded in the idea of sowing and reaping. If you want good fruit, then you must first make the tree good, as Jesus said. Anyone who plants an apple tree should not expect grapefruit, or vice versa. The way we behave today plants seeds for what our character will be like tomorrow.\n\nPart of working through the book involves writing your own personal mission statement. This isn\u2019t something I would normally ever do, but again I found the process of sitting down to think about it very inspiring.\n\nHere\u2019s what I came up with for my mission statement:\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to always remind people that they are more beautiful than they imagine and dearly loved by God. I want to use every gift and talent I have been given to reflect the love of God and point people to Jesus who is the best picture we could have of who God really is, and who we are called to be like.\u201d\n\n\nHave you ever thought about what your mission statement would be? What would you include? I\u2019d love to hear yours if you take time to write it out and share it in the comments below.\n\nAlso, what would you want people to say about you at your funeral? What are you doing now to make sure that what they say about you lines up with the impression you hope to make on the people around you?\n\nShare those in the comments if you can.\n\nFinally, if you haven\u2019t done so yet, please subscribe to the blog and share this post with your friends on social media.\n\nThanks!\n\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who left the pulpit to start a house church in Orange County, California where 100% of the offerings go to help the poor in his community.\n\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/personal-mission-statement/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
239,Gender Identity in the Body of Christ,"November 20, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nMany Christians profess to hold a \u201cBiblical view\u201d of gender, marriage, and sexuality, but they are wildly selective when it comes to how they choose verses in scripture to support their views.\nImage via Pixaby\n\xa0\nEssentially, what most of those people are doing is deciding ahead of time what they believe about gender, sexuality, and marriage in advance and then carefully selecting only those verses that support their narrow views. This is called \u201cEisegesis\u201d and it\u2019s the other side of the coin to the more reputable and honest process of \u201cExegesis\u201d where one only forms an opinion after examining the entirety of what is taught in the scriptures.\n\n\nSo, for example, if you were to point out that in the scriptures, men are called the Bride of Christ, and that women are called the Sons of God, and that all are called the Body of Christ, you\u2019d probably be accused of blasphemy or heresy, or both. But these are the facts. The scriptures lump everyone together \u2013 both male and female \u2013 into one genderless organism.\nPaul famously put it this way:\n\u201cAs many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.\u201d (Galatians 3:27-28)\nYes, I do understand that Paul is aiming to communicate that those distinctions of race, class, and gender no longer apply or carry weight in the Body of Christ (and that is a lesson many Christians have still yet to accept), but there is still the reality here that Paul is saying that \u201cmale and female\u201d are \u201cno longer\u201d relevant distinctions for us.\nI remember having a conversation a few years ago with a young man who admitted that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the language that Jesus loved him, or that he should love Jesus intimately and become the Bride of Christ. On one level, I could understand, but I had to ask him, \u201cDo you love your Father?\u201d and he said, \u201cOf course, I do.\u201d Then I asked him, \u201cDoes your Father love you?\u201d and he nodded.\n\n\nSo then I said, \u201cyou\u2019re both males, and yet you and your Dad have no trouble admitting a deep love for one another. How is this any different from loving Jesus?\u201d\n\n\nHe squinted at me and said, \u201cBut it says I am supposed to become the Bride of Christ. That\u2019s\u2026.weird.\u201d\nAnd I had to admit that he was right. It is kinda weird for a guy to think of himself as becoming the Bride of Christ. But it\u2019s also kinda weird for a woman to see herself as one of the \u201csons of God\u201d which is true for everyone who is in Christ.\nFor those who adamantly demand that \u201cBiblical marriage\u201d is one man and one woman, and insist that marriage is intended to be a picture of Christ and the Church (as Paul stresses in Ephesians 5:22-32), it can be quite scandalous to point out to them that scripture explicitly tells us that when Jesus returns he will marry billions of men and call them his bride, (see Rev. 19:6-9).\nSo, if marriage is supposed to be a metaphor for Christ and the Church, what do we with the fact that Jesus intends to engage in a gigantic same-sex marriage with every man who has ever put faith in Him?\nLike it or not, the Bible doesn\u2019t always play nice with those who insist on rigid distinctions of male and female, nor does it have one unifying perspective on marriage as one man and one woman.\n\n\nWe are all \u2013 male and female (and otherwise) \u2013 incorporated into the Body of Christ, even as both Adam and Eve were once hidden together in one flesh at the beginning of Creation when God made a creature in His own image.\nKeep in mind, God does not have a penis or a vagina. God is not male or female. We use the term \u201cHe\u201d simply because we prefer not to refer to God as an \u201cIt\u201d, but God has no gender. God is a Spirit, (John 4:24).\nThe Scriptures use male pronouns and metaphors to refer to God, but there are many female metaphors and pronouns used to portray God, including pictures of God as a nursing mother, and a God who gives birth to us, and a God who gathers us like a mother hen gathers her chicks.\nThe Bible is very progressive when it comes to these ideas of gender, marriage, and sexuality. It might do us some good to go back and read those passages again with fresh eyes and an open heart.\nWhat do you think?\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon best-seller, \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He lives in Orange, CA with his wife and 2 sons. \n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/gender-identity-body-christ/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
240,When Being Right Is Very Wrong,"November 19, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nHave you ever wondered why Jesus didn\u2019t write the New Testament or the Gospels personally? Wouldn\u2019t that have once and for all eliminated any arguments about scripture being inerrant and perfect? \n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps that is exactly why Jesus didn\u2019t write it personally. Maybe He depended upon human beings who would share their understandings with us so that we would have no other choice but to discern their meaning for ourselves, question their motives, weigh their judgment, and test everything they said by the Holy Spirit.\n\n\n\xa0\n\nImage via Pixaby\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t this exactly why Jesus told us that it was better for us if He went away; so that He could send us the Holy Spirit who would lead us into all Truth? (See John 16:13)\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nIf the goal was to hand us a text that could never be questioned, then Jesus Himself could have penned every word and handed it to the Apostles. But He did not do that. Instead, He allowed them to write down what they remembered, and even to disagree with one another about what exactly happened, and when, and how. He allows us to read those words today with the guidance of the same Holy Spirit who speaks to us and reveals the truth to us. He allows us to dialog with one another over what we understand and what we don\u2019t understand. \n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\nAs always, Jesus is comfortable with our questions. He wants us to work it out. He trusts us to wrestle with the unknown and to dig out the answers one at a time. He is not troubled by unanswered questions, either. Jesus was asked dozens of questions during His earthly ministry and not only did leave most of them unanswered, he usually responded with a few questions of His own; many of which also went unanswered.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nWe, unfortunately, are a people who are obsessed with answers. We want to \u201cknow\u201d the truth. We want everything spelled out for us. We want a formula, but the trouble is, once we have a formula we don\u2019t need God anymore, do we? \n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nSee, God wants us to lean on Him. He wants us to come to Him to have life, not to a book. God wants us to admit that we don\u2019t have it all figured out by coming to Him with our questions and inquiring of Him for wisdom. \n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nOur problem is, we don\u2019t like to look foolish. We also don\u2019t want to be wrong. We don\u2019t want people to think we\u2019re not smart, or that we don\u2019t have it all figured out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nBut the truth is, we are not so smart. We do not have all the answers. There are many great mysteries of Christ that we do not yet understand.\n\n\nFor example, the other day I posted on Facebook: \u201cHow to explain the Trinity: Don\u2019t\u201d, and in response, I received several dozen comments which attempted to do exactly what I just suggested we should not do.\n\nI fear that many of us today are too sure of ourselves. We are immune to mystery. We are obsessed with proving to everyone else how wrong they are and how right we are.\n\nWe love being right. We have practically redefined Christianity as having the right information about God. In this paradigm, the greatest sin and heresy is to be wrong.\n\n\n\nThe fruit of this way of thinking is that anyone who disagrees with our individual theology is a heretic and anathema to us. We refuse to associate or fellowship with anyone who doesn\u2019t hold to our doctrines. We elevate information about God to the highest level.\n\nBut when we look at the Gospels, and the rest of the New Testament,\xa0it seems that \u201cTransformation\u201d is much more important than \u201cInformation.\u201d In fact, when Jesus says that \u201ceternal life is to know God and His Son whom He has sent,\u201d (See John 17:3) the word translated as \u201cto know\u201d in the Greek is \u201cGinosko\u201d which maps to the same word used to say that \u201cAdam knew Eve and she conceived a child.\u201d In other words, the kind of \u201cknowledge\u201d Jesus is referring to in this case is an intimacy that conceives something within us.\n\nAnd what is it that this \u201cintimate knowledge of God\u201d conceives in us? A new life in Christ.\n\n\n\nSee, God is ok with our questions. He is not troubled by our lack of wisdom, but He is concerned about our abundance of pride. Those who receive grace from God are the humble, not the proud. Remember?\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\u201cGod opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.\u201d (James 4:6) \n\n\xa0\nSo, maybe it\u2019s ok to admit that we don\u2019t have all the right information about God. Maybe we can embrace the possibility that we might have a few things wrong in our theology and get over it.\n\n\n\nWhat matters isn\u2019t having all the right information about God. What matters is to know God so intimately that His new life is conceived within us.\n\nThe Gospel is about Transformation, not Information.\n\nLet\u2019s give up on being right and embrace the mystery of God.\n\n-kg\n**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including the Amazon best-seller \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He is also the co-host of \u201cThe Heretic Happy Hour\u201d Podcast.

241,How Jesus Inverts Psalm 73,"November 18, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\n\nImage via Pixaby\nThe other day I was reflecting on how the Psalmists complain to God about the prosperity of the wicked.\n\n\nI understood how it must have felt for the Israelites to see their enemies \u2013 who were pagans \u2013 flourishing and growing strong and wealthy, while they \u2013 the \u201cPeople of God\u201d \u2013 were suffering, poor, weak and downcast.\nAnyone would question this outcome under the same circumstances. Anyone would wonder what good it was to follow their faith if those of another faith were experiencing better results.\nOf course, faith isn\u2019t necessarily about results, but it\u2019s human nature to feel this way, and respond this way.\nWhen the Israelites were in bondage to other nations \u2013 pagan nations who mocked their God and profaned their faith in Him \u2013 they felt a very strong sense of injustice. They chafed at being on the bottom while those godless pagans were on top.\nThey had no power, while the pagans had power over them. They had no wealth, while those evil people had riches and comfort. They were humbled, yet their enemies were proud.\nYou can read for yourself how this made them feel:\n\n\xa0\u201cFor I envied\xa0the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.\n\nThey have no struggles;\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0their bodies are healthy and strong.\nThey are free\xa0from common human burdens;\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0they are not plagued by human ills.\n\n\nTherefore pride\xa0is their necklace;\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0they clothe themselves with violence.\nFrom their callous hearts\xa0comes iniquity;\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0their evil imaginations have no limits.\n\n\nThey scoff, and speak with malice;\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0with arrogance\xa0they threaten oppression.\n\xa0Their mouths lay claim to heaven,\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and their tongues take possession of the earth.\n\xa0Therefore their people turn to them\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and drink up waters in abundance.\n\xa0They say, \u201cHow would God know?\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Does the Most High know anything?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\xa0This is what the wicked are like\u2014\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0always free of care,\xa0they go on amassing wealth.\n\n\n\xa0Surely in vain\xa0I have kept my heart pure\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and have washed my hands in innocence.\n\xa0All day long I have been afflicted,\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0and every morning brings new punishments.\u201d\xa0[Psalm 73:14]\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom line: The Jewish people were on the bottom. Their enemies were on the top. They wanted God to reverse the order. They were desperate for the day when they would be on the top and their enemies would be crushed beneath their feet.\n\nBut then\xa0 I realized something that blew my mind: When Jesus shows up, he\xa0does\xa0reverse the order, but not in the way they expected. Jesus says, \u201cBeing on the bottom is where the entrance to the Kingdom is found. People on the bottom are blessed of God.\u201d Not only this, Jesus essentially tells them, \u201cWe will not crush our enemies, we will embrace them, and love them, and serve them, and forgive them.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reversal takes place, but not politically. Instead, Jesus reverses the order in their mind. He flips their perspective.\n\n\nSee, Jesus\u2019s mission was not to overthrow the Roman oppressors and exalt the Jewish Empire. His mission was to heal the World. He did not come to bring justice for some and punishment for others. He came to show us that everyone is our neighbor and our brother. He told us that all are equally loved by God and that because this is true, we should be like God and bless (and love) everyone, too. Yes, even the godless pagans who oppress us.\n\n\n\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount is one huge inversion of Psalm 73. It says, \u201cThe oppressed are blessed. The oppressors are too. God\u2019s favor really does rest on both the righteous and the unjust. God\u2019s love is universal and falls like the rain on everyone, no matter what. If they love God, they are blessed. If they reject Him, they are still blessed and loved. So, if this is how God behaves, then those who want to be like God, and those who want to truly be the \u2018children of God\u2019, should do what God does \u2013 love everyone and share blessings with everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf we do that, then we will live in the Kingdom of God. This is how we change the world. Not by violence and war. Not by winning so that others can lose. But by finding a way to help everyone see the Kingdom and enter into this wide open way of loving as God loves.\n\n\nCan we do this? Yes, but only if we remain so close to Jesus that we begin to think like Him; and we begin to breathe Him in and realize that He is closer than our own heartbeat and alive within our own body. Without Him, we can really do nothing. But if we abide in Him, then He lives and breathes in us, and once that happens, the world will begin to change, and that change will start with us.\n\n\n\n\nSelah.\n\xa0**\nKeith Giles is the author of several books, including \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb.\u201d He is also the co-host of \u201cThe Heretic Happy Hour\u201d Podcast.\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/jesus-inverts-psalm-73/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
242,Let\u2019s Repeal Second Amendment Christianity,"November 17, 2017",Keith Giles,"\n\nImage via Pixaby\n\n\nA few thousand years ago, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for a gathering of Christians to be interrupted by men with weapons. In those days, the government actively persecuted Christians; arresting church leaders, jailing members, torturing those who refused to pledge allegiance to the Empire and publically executing those who were especially dangerous to the State.\n\n\n\nOf course, this sort of thing has been going on ever since. Today, somewhere in the world, Christians are still in danger of being arrested, beaten, tortured or killed for their faith.\n\n\nIn America, what many deem to be a \u201cChristian Nation\u201d, there is a curious twist to this narrative. Here, where our faith is largely celebrated and openly accepted, Christians are still in danger of being shot and killed while sitting in the worship service. But the differences are that here, unlike in those other nations, the Christians being killed in the pews are subject to being shot, in part, because\xa0of their devotion to the State, not because they oppose it.\n\xa0That\u2019s what\u2019s so strange, really.\nChristians a few thousand years ago were killed for defying the Empire. Today, Christians are convinced that God loves their Empire more than all the others. They also believe that God has given them the right to kill others \u2013 even to violently rebel against their own \u201cChristian Nation\u201d if necessary.\nThose early Christians were unanimous in their insistence that Jesus demanded non-violent love in response to violence. They loved their neighbors in spite of the threats. They showed their love for their Nation by refusing to retaliate when provoked.\nToday\u2019s American Christians show their love for their Nation by refusing to challenge the notion that everyone deserves the right to stockpile weapons.\n\n\nEarly Christians willingly sold their possessions to share with those in poverty around them. Today\u2019s Christians will kill anyone who dares to come after their possessions.\nEarly Christians, for the first 300 years at least, refused to own weapons and no historic accounts exist of any of them using violence to resist their persecutors or prevent other Christians from being arrested or killed.\nToday\u2019s American Christians refuse to allow anyone to take away their weapons. Even if it means this may keep them\xa0in danger of being brutally killed while they worship on a Sunday morning.\nWhy would they do this? Is there something in the teachings of Christ that drives them to inaction in the face of continuous gun violence?\nSadly, not. In fact, many of these same Christians reject the idea that Jesus taught non-violence or enemy love. They tend to believe that every American citizen has the right to own as many semi-automatic machine guns as they want. In fact, they will consistently defend that right at the drop of a hat and become extremely emotional if you try to suggest that this ideology is exactly the reason why so many people \u2013 including Christians \u2013 get gunned down by people with semi-automatic machine guns.\n\n\n \n\nBe Careful What You Love\nSo, essentially, American Christians have a deep and abiding love for the Second Amendment. That love is deeper and more abiding than their love for the commands of Jesus not to harm anyone, even enemies, for any reason. The idea of turning the other cheek and overcoming evil with good not only seems foolish to them, it seems impossible.\nIt\u2019s hard to blame them, really. Their pastors and teacher never really teach them anything about how devoted those earliest Christians were to those same love commands that Jesus gave to us. They usually only hear sermons that fit into the American Nationalist narrative.\nTheir Jesus looks more like a free-market capitalist Abraham Lincoln than the suffering servant who said, \u201cFather, forgive them. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nSo, many American Christians are especially immune to the Sermon on the Mount. They know more about the Constitution than the teachings of Christ.\nThis is why they are more likely arm their people so they can shoot the killer before he can shoot them on a Sunday morning. They just don\u2019t have any better ideas than what their Founding Fathers gave to them a few hundred years ago.\n\n\nDecoding Jesus?\nWhen Jesus tells them that their Heavenly Father is kind to the sinner and the righteous alike, and that to be like God is to show love to everyone \u2013 even those who hate you \u2013 they assume it must be some sort of complicated parable or a riddle that is meant to lead them to throw up their hands in defeat so that they can bask in His infinite Grace. Or something.\nEssentially, the Founding Fathers supersede the Heavenly Father and the Second Amendment overrides the Eight Beatitudes.\nBelieve it or not, for all of my dripping cynicism, I really do have a hope that one day these Christians might abandon their faith in American politics and develop a very real hunger and thirst for the wisdom of the Nazarene.\nThere is so much life in His teaching. There is so much hope. Without it, I don\u2019t think I could make it another day.\nWho knows? Maybe if a few of us wake up to embrace the words of Jesus spoken so long ago, we might just discover that God has an answer to our violence, and our pain, and our selfishness.\n\n\nMaybe, one day, American Christians will have the courage to repeal their Second Amendment ideology and fully embrace those Eight Beatitudes of Christ.\nUntil then, I guess we\u2019re stuck with the status quo.\nHere\u2019s to progress.\n\xa0-Keith Giles\n**\nKeith Giles is the Author of \u201cJesus Untangled: Crucifying Our Politics To Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb\u201d and the co-host of \u201cThe Heretic Happy Hour Podcast\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n",https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles/2017/11/lets-repeal-second-amendment-christianity/,keithgiles,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/keithgiles,Progressive Christian,https://www.patheos.com/progressive-christian
